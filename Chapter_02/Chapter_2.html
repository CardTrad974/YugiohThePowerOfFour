        <b>Yugo: </b><a class="imag card"><i>Rin</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/800px-Rin_Praises_Yugo's_Stubborness.png" style="width: 550px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a>
        <b> ! Rin, where are you !? RIN !</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <a class="imag card"><i>Yugo</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/de137bz-00399d25-cb6e-429a-88fb-6bea18eb1e9e.png" style="height: 450px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a> 
        had been searching everywhere for Rin for a while now, with no trace to her whereabouts. He felt stupid; he should NEVER have left her alone. Yugo knew someone had 
        been following her lately, so he kept his guard up to protect her. Now the one time he had left Rin, when he thought she would be safe at their place, was obviously 
        the time he should've been there for her.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Dammit ! This was my fault ! I shouldn't have left Rin alone ! I should've stayed with her !</b><br>
        Yugo cursed himself for his blunder. Earlier that evening, he wanted to stay with Rin to keep an eye out for whoever was tailing her.
    </p>

    <p><i>Flashback</i></p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: I will be okay if I stay home tonight. I really feel that I'll be safe here while you go get some takeout.</b><br>
        She said to her childhood friend. Of course, Yugo protested.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yugo: No way ! I ain't leaving you by yourself Rin, not for a second! What if whoever's been following you knows where we live ? I need to be here to kick his ass if he tries to hurt you !
        </b><br>
        Rin tried to assure him that it would be fine.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Rin: It'll be alright Yugo. After you leave, I'll lock the door and secure all the windows. And if anyone happens to knock and it isn't someone we know, I'm 
            definitely not letting them in. Trust me, I'll be fine here.
        </b><br>
        Yugo didn't look convinced as he crossed his arms.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yugo: I still don't agree. What if something does happen to you and I'm not here to help ? I could never forgive myself.
        </b><br>
        He said softly, looking truly worried. Rin smiled as she hugged her friend.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Rin: I really appreciate you caring so much and wanting to protect me. Everything will be fine. Okay ?</b><br>
        Rin said as she gave him one of her smiles that he just couldn't say no too.
    </p>

    <p>
        Very reluctantly, Yugo finally agreed to head out to get some food. He took off on their D-Wheel and promised to be back soon. Later, when he came home with their 
        dinner, Yugo knew he had made a grave mistake.
    </p>

    <p>
        He immediately saw that their door had been broken down, and in pieces. Worst of all, Rin was gone. She was nowhere to be seen. Yugo cursed so loudly he thought the 
        whole Commons area could hear him. Then, on his D-Wheel, he began to search for his lifelong friend. He was afraid he might never find her.
    </p>

    <p><i>Flashback End</i></p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Please Rin… PLEASE be alright !</b>
    </p>

    <p>Yugo said to himself as he continued to look. Unbeknownst to Yugo, Rin's guardian angel was already on the move…</p>

    <hr size="1" noshade="">

    <p>
        Rin was scared as hell as she ran for her life. She had no idea who this psycho was or why he was after her. All she knew was that she couldn't let him catch her. As 
        she ran, she berated herself for convincing Yugo to leave. He wanted to stay by Rin and had every reason to do so. Her own stupidity led to this chase in the night.
    </p>

    <p>
        After turning a corner, Rin saw to her dismay that she had hit a dead end. She turned around with her back against the wall. She had never felt so afraid in her whole 
        life. Her pursuer then slowed his pace, knowing he had trapped her.
    </p>

    <p>
        Underneath his cloak, <a class="imag card"><i>Yuri</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Yuri.png" style="width: 550px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a> smiled. 
        After the big screwup in the Xyz Dimension, Yuri made sure no one would get the drop on him this time. He didn't want to take any chances. After arriving in the 
        Synchro Dimension, he scouted around his surroundings as he silently stalked the green haired girl with the bracelet, named Rin.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Yuri saw no one that could give him any trouble, though that guy who shared his face stuck to Rin like glue. He kinda wondered why they looked alike, like that 
        <a class="imag card"><i>other punk</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/FullYuto.png" style="height: 450px;"></span></a> in the Xyz Dimension 
        who escaped with <a class="imag card"><i>Ruri</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Lulu_Obsidian.png" style="height: 350px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a>. 
        Honestly, he didn't care as long as he was able to carry out his mission.
    </p>

    <p>
        This new guy almost never left Rin's side. He was in no hurry, so he waited for the right moment to pounce. His chance finally came when the guy rode away on that 
        fancy vehicle of his, leaving the girl alone. This led to the chase that took place tonight… a chase that now came to an end.
    </p>

    <p>
        Rin felt like screaming, to call for help. She wanted to yell so loud that Yugo would be able to find her in time. The problem was, she couldn't. Overwhelming fear had 
        taken hold of her, unable to do anything other than watch as the cloaked stranger came closer. Rin wished she had a Duel Disk so she could defend herself. She hated 
        feeling that way; defenseless and afraid.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yuri: This game of tag is over. Now come with me... to the Professor.<br></b>
        aid the man, nearly close enough to touch her. Rin had no idea who this Professor was, but he must be a real sicko if he sent someone to kidnap teenage girls like her. 
        She was pinned to the wall and had no hope of escape.
    </p>

    <p>Yuri smiled triumphantly as he moved in to take her.</p>

    <p><b>Yuri: Ku, ku, ku...Gaaahhh !</b></p>

    <p>
        That was when he felt it, a sharp blow on the back of the neck. He gasped loudly from the unexpected pain, making Rin gasp too. He immediately blacked out as he hit 
        the ground in a bundled heap.
    </p>

    <p>Rin was shocked by this turn of events. She stared down at her would be kidnapper, puzzled at what had happened.</p>
    
    <p>
        <i>
            Rin: Is he really…out cold ?
        </i><br>
        She thought, afraid to move to find out.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>???: Are you alright ?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Asked a new voice. Unlike the man that chased her, this one sounded older and much kinder. Slowly, eyes wide, Rin looked up at her unexpected hero. The young man 
        before her was indeed older, and taller with a criminal mark on the left side of his face. Rin could tell that he was being sincere about her wellbeing. After a 
        moment, she finally started to calm down.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: I… I think so. Thanks.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        She said near breathlessly. The man nodded as he smiled. Somehow, Rin felt sure this new person truly meant no ill will. Not like the man that came close to capturing 
        her. She then looked down at him again.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Is he...?</b><br>She had started to ask, but the newcomer shook his head.
    </p>

    <p><b>???: He'll be out for a while. Don't worry.</b></p>

    <p>Rin felt more and more that she could trust this man.</p>
    
    <p><b>Rin: Who are you ? Why did you save me ?</b></p>

    <p>The young man looked at Rin, and gave him a comforting smile.</p>

        She asked, startled.

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: You and Yugo. I came to help you both.</b><br>Yusei answered.
    </p>

    <p>Rin was filled with so many questions she didn't know where to begin. Before she could ask her next one…</p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: RIN !</b><br>
        Rin and Yusei turned to see Yugo pulling up behind them and removing his helmet.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: YUGO !</b>

    </p>
    
    <p>
        Rin shouted back as she ran to him. As they met, they hugged each other so tight that neither one of them ever wanted to let go.

    <p>
        Yusei smiled, pleased that the two were together again. This would save them the trouble of finding him later. For he knew they had to leave, and quick. But first, he 
        had to let them catch up and reassure one another.
    </p>

    <p><b>Rin: Yugo ! I'm okay ! I am so glad you're here ! I was so frightened !</b></p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Rin, when I got back, the door was down and you were gone ! I searched everywhere for you ! What the hell happened !?</b>
        <br>Yugo demanded as he broke the hug and looked Rin in the face… a face filled with guilt.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Rin: Well, after you left, everything was pretty quiet at first. Then I heard someone knocking on the front door. Whoever it was didn't say anything, so I knew it 
            couldn't be you. You always announced yourself when you came back. I instantly ran to my room and closed the door. I kept listening for any voices, but I still 
            heard only knocking. Then there was silence… right before I heard a loud crashing sound ! I knew the door had been forced open, so I jumped out my bedroom window 
            and ran for it ! I've been running ever since !
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>She stopped to catch her breath. Yugo became more and more pissed with each detail.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: That bastard has been chasing you this whole damn time !?</b>
    </p>

    <p>He asked, enraged by the scumbag who put Rin through hell tonight. Rin nodded. Yugo then looked remorseful.</p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Rin, I'm so sorry. If only I had stayed with you…</b><br>Yugo started, but Rin cut him off.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Rin: No, Yugo. I'm the one that's sorry. You were right. I should've listened to you. I never imagined that slimeball would have the nerve to break into our home. 
            That one's on me.
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: It doesn't matter, you're okay now. So what happened next ?</b><br>
        Yugo asked, wanting to hear the rest of the story.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Rin: I kept on running, right up until he cornered me here. He said he was going to take me to someone called "The Professor." Don't ask me, I have no idea who he 
            was talking about. Anyway, before he could lay a hand on me, he was struck from behind… by him.
        </b><br>

        Rin finished as she finally revealed Yusei.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Who's he ?</b><br>
        Yugo asked, never seen the guy before.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: That's Yusei Fudo. He just saved my life. One blow from him and the other guy was out for the count. I was just thanking him when you pulled up.</b><br>
        Rin said as she finished her story. Yugo looked over at Yusei with interest.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: You really saved Rin ?</b><br>Yugo asked to Yusei.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yusei: I did.</b><br>Yusei answered. At once, Yugo smiled as he walked up to him and held out his fist.</p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Thanks man ! Anyone who helps Rin like that is a friend in my book !</b><br>
        ugo declared. Smiling back, Yusei bumped the younger boy's fist with his own. Yugo then looked over at the unconscious form of Rin's pursuer.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yugo: So, who is that lowlife anyway ?</b></p>

    <p><b>Yugo: I'll show you.</b><br>Yusei said as he stood above Yuri, poised to remove his hood.</p>

    <p><b>Yugo: Wait. He's not going to like… wake up, is he ?</b><br>Yugo questioned, acting cautiously.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: No, I hit him pretty hard. I have to warn you two. What you're about to see will be very shocking… for both of you.</b><br>
        Yusei cautioned the pair.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Shocking in what way?</b><br>Rin asked, not knowing what Yusei meant.

    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Look.</b><br>
        Yusei simply said as he pulled back Yuri's hood, giving Yugo and Rin a very good look. Their reactions were exactly what Yusei expected.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Rin: No way !</b><br>Rin gasped as she covered her mouth, eyes widened again.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        <b>Yugo: What the !? He looks… just like me !</b><br>Yugo said, completely stunned.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yugo: Why does that prick look like me ? Who the hell is that !?</b></p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: His name is Yuri. He was ordered by a man named </b>
        <a class="imag card"><i>Akaba Leo</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/de2lq9z-0bf14a08-5e45-40b4-a077-96976f57d5c6.png" style="width: 450px;"></span></a>
        <b> to capture Rin and take her to him. I came here to stop him.</b><br>
        Yusei explained.
    </p>

    <p><b>Rin: Akaba Leo ? Is he this "Professor" that Yuri mentioned before ?</b><br>Rin asked.</p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Yes. He is known as "The Professor" where he is.</b><br>Yusei replied as he lowered Yuri's hood again.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: That still doesn't explain why he and I look the same! Is he like my evil twin brother or something !?</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>Yugo asked, angry and confused by this whole situation.</p>

    <p><b>Yusei: Not exactly. Your connection with Yuri… actually goes much deeper than that.</b><br>Yusei said vaguely.</p>
        
    <p><b>Yugo: Deeper ? Deeper how ? What do you mean ?</b><br>Yugo asked, sounding more curious than upset.</p>
     
    <p>
        <b>Rin: And what does Yuri's boss want with me ?</b><br>Rin asked, still not understanding what all this had to do with her.

    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Yusei: I promise to explain everything, but not right now. We need to leave City as soon as we can. I have to get you both to safety.</b><br>
        Yusei stated as he walked by them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>
            Yugo: Wait, we're leaving? As in… going out of town leaving ? 
        </b><br>
        Yugo asked in further surprise.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yusei: It's not safe for Rin to stay here, now that Yuri and Leo know where she lives. She needs to be someplace out of the reach of those two. And you need to stay with her, Yugo.
        </b><br>
        Yusei said strongly while walking to a shadowed spot nearby.
    </p>
      
    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Humph ! Believe me Yusei, after tonight, I'm NEVER letting Rin out of my sight again !</b><br>Yugo declared as he held an arm around her.
    </p> 
    

    <p>Rin smiled at her friend's determination to keep her safe, even if he annoyed the hell out of her most of the time.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Until Leo Akaba is dealt with and no longer a threat. That could take days, possibly weeks.</b><br>
        Yusei surmised, surprising the duo.

    <p>
        <b>
            Rin: Look Yugo, I don't want to miss the Friendship Cup either. We've both worked hard so that we could compete in it, but things have changed. If what Yusei says

       Rin said, knowing how disappointed they both felt.

    <p><b>Yugo: But Rin...</b><br></p>

    <p>Yugo tried, but couldn't make a convincing argument. She understood as she held both his shoulders.</p>

            Rin: I know. I'm sad too that we might have to miss it, but there's always next year. Who knows, maybe by then I'll have my own D-Wheel ! Then we can duel each

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: I hadn't thought of that ! That would be so sweet !</b><br>Rin chuckled, glad to see Yugo fired up again.
    </p>

    <p>

        <i>Yusei: If only they knew just where they would be heading off too, and who they would meet when we get there…</i>
    </p>
   
    <p>He could imagine their reactions when they meet "him".</p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: By the way, what are you doing over there, Yusei ?</b><br>Yugo asked, now noticing his new friend's actions.

    </p>
    
    <p><b>Yusei: Making sure my own D-Wheel has not been tampered with during my stay here. Everything seems to be in perfect order.</b></p>

    <p>Underneath it was a sleek red and white D-Wheel. Yugo and Rin were amazed by it.</p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Woah ! That's your D-Wheel ? It looks totally sick !</b><br>Yugo said excitedly as he took in every detail.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: I agree. Did you build it yourself ?</b><br>Rin asked, with Yusei nodding.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: I did build it, with the help of some old friends of mine.</b>
    </p>

    <p>Yusei said, remembering the old days with his 
        <a class="imag card"><i>original crew</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Capture.PNG"></span></a> in Satellite.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Amazing! Rin and I built this one ourselves too! </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Yugo said proudly as he patted the white <a class="imag card"><i>DWheel</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Yugo's_Duel_Runner.png" style="width: 550px;"></span></a> beside him. 
        Yusei told them they did a good job on it before he got on his D-Wheel and placed his helmet on.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yusei: Okay, both of you need to follow me. I know a quick way out that won't draw any Security forces around here. Are you two ready ?
        </b><br>Yusei, looking behind him.
    </p>

    <p>At his insistence, Yugo and Rin got on their D-Wheel and put on their own helmets as well.</p>
    
    <p><b>Yugo: You ready, Rin ?</b><br>Yugo asked.</p>

    <p><b>Rin: I'm all set.</b><br>Rin confirmed.</p>

    <p>Yugo: Yep, we're both good to go !<br>Yugo announced.</p>

    <p><b>Yusei: Good. Let's move !</b><br>Yusei then hit the accelerator and his D-Wheel went flying.</p>

    <p><b>Yugo: Right behind ya Yusei !</b></p>

    <p>
        Yugo responded as he and Rin sped after him. It scared the two of them leaving their home for an unknown amount of time to an unknown place. However, they had faith in 
        their new friend and ally that everything will turn out alright. Unfortunately, their departure won't be as smooth as they hoped it would be…

    <p>
        At the Sector Security's headquarters, the Director himself sat as he observed the happenings of his "Kingdom". 
        <br><a class="imag card"><i>Jean Michel Roget</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/800px-Jean_Michel_Roget.png" style="width: 550px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a>, a 
        tall well dressed man with light blonde hair, worked hard to get where he was at, and he was definitely enjoying the benefits of being in charge. Well, in charge of 
        Sector Security that is.
    </p>

    <p>
        Officially, the <a class="imag card"><i>City Council</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Council_and_Jean.png" style="width: 550px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a> 
        was in charge the City itself.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>Roget: Those old fools.</i><br>
        Roget thought to himself that evening.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>
            Roget: If it weren't for them, I'd be the sole ruler. But very soon, after my "secret weapon" destroys Jack Atlas in the Friendship Cup and wins, total domination

        </i>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        He very looked forward to seeing the current Duel King being crushed by "him". However, as he mused over this inevitable outcome, he got an alert from one of his 
        officers on the comm system.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Roget: Yes ?</b><br>
        Roget asked dully, not believing anything could go wrong to tonight. His panic stricken officer proved him otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b><i>Officer: Director, we have a situation ! Sergey is gone !</i></b><br>
        The man shouted. The news made Roget spring out of his chair in shock.
    </p>

    <p><b>Roget: WHAT !? What do you mean "gone" !? Where is he !?</b><br>Roget demanded.</p>

    <p>
        <b>
            <i>
                Officer: I don't know, sir ! I was about to leave for the night when I heard a loud noise coming from the garage area. I went to check it, and several officers

            </i>

    </p>

    <p>Roget slammed his fist on the desk in frustration.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Roget: Damn, not again.</b><br>
        Roget muttered to himself. He knew controlling that beast of a human would be difficult, even with all the "adjustments" to his body after taking custody of him.
    </p>

    <p><b>Roget: His programming must still be glitchy.</b><br>he thought.</p>
    
    <p>He would have to make more adjustments to him after they bring him back.</p>

    <p><b>Roget: Don't just sit there you lot, we have an asset loose on the streets ! Find him, now !</b><br>Roget ordered.</p>

    <p><b>Surveillance Team: Yes Director !</b></p>

    <p>
        His surveillance team said as they got to work. Roget hoped they'd find Sergey before he did something to cause any kind of disturbance. Somehow though, he doubted that.

        Yusei, Yugo, and Rin continued their ride out of the City. So far, no interference from Sector Security. At the rate they were going, they would be home free before 
        the end of the night. Then, once they were outside the City's limits, Yusei would activate his beacon so the three of them would get picked up by their "transport."
    </p>

    <p>As they came out of a tunnel, Yusei could see a big, bright bridge not far away.</p>

    <p><b>Yusei: There ! Once we cross that bridge, we should be far enough for me to contact…</b></p>

    <p>Yusei stopped talking when he turned to face Yugo and Rin. He saw something big and fast coming up from behind them !</p>
    
    <p><b>Yusei: Yugo ! Rin ! Behind you !</b></p>

    <p>
        Yugo moved his D-Wheel out of the way just in time as a huge black and gold <a class="imag card"><i>DWheel</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Sergey_Duel_Runner.png" style="width: 550px;"></span></a> 
        strongly resembling a chariot came roaring past him and Rin. It had huge spikes protruding from both sides of the front wheel. Yugo's D-Wheel barely missed being 
        scratched by the unknown rider.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Rin ! You okay ?</b><br>Yugo asked, worried for his friend.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Rin: Yes, I'm fine. Who is that ?</b><br>She asked as the rider caught up with Yusei.</p>

    <p><b>Yugo: Whoever that guy is, he obviously ain't friendly.</b><br>Yugo said to Rin.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Hey ! What's your problem, Jackass !?</b><br>
        Yugo shouted to the man that nearly ran them over. He knew that jerk wasn't from Sector Security, not from the look of him. The man was now side by side with Yusei.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Who are you ? And what do you want ?</b><br>
        Yusei asked strongly. The man gave a twisted smile.

    <p>
        Even though he was pissed, Roget was inwardly relived that he wasn't identified yet by the media. He hoped it would stay that way. He then noticed the other rider 
        alongside Sergey.
    </p>

    <p><b>Roget: Who is the other Duelist ?</b><br>He questioned after calming down a bit.</p>

    <p><b>Woman: We don't know, sir. Judging by his appearance, he's most likely one of the Commons.</b><br>Said the first woman.</p>

        Yugo paled, knowing what this could mean if Yusei loses this Duel.

        He pondered how to pull that off as the Duel continued.

            Roget: Yes. It's almost over now. That man may have fought hard, but in the end it was never enough. Scum like him could NEVER take down Sergey Volkov, the Duelist 
            Crusher ! Even Jack Atlas himself won't stand a chance once they face off in the Friendship Cup. One more turn is what Sergey needs to…

    <p><b>Roget: WHAT !?</b></p>

    <p>Roget thought he heard things. Surely that Commons couldn't possibly think that… but then Roget remembered something. He started to sweat now.</p>

    <p>

    <p>What he saw next would nearly cause him a mental breakdown.</p>

    <p>In the Duel, Yusei had just brought back Stardust Dragon. Sergey was about to declare the start of his next turn when…</p>

        Jean Michael Roget, Director of Sector Security, stood in complete shock and total disbelief. His secret weapon, his means of toppling the Duel King…was defeated by 
        some unknown rat from the Commons. And the worst part was that the whole thing had been caught on camera, meaning everyone had witnessed it. Even Jack Atlas himself 
        had to have seen this unforeseen event. Unable to to contain his fury, he let loose a long, drawn out scream of outrage.

        As she saw Sergey's defeat at the hands of Yusei, Melissa Claire almost fell out of the copter in shock.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Melissa Claire: I…I don't believe it ! Tell me you filmed that !? Everyone, something unbelievable has just happened tonight ! I'm still having a hard time seeing 
            it with my own eyes ! Sergey Volkov, the "Duelist Crusher", whom no one, I repeat, NO ONE PERSON, has ever brought down in a Duel… was just defeated by the 
            unidentified newcomer ! This is definitely one for the history books ! Whoever the red rider is, I'm now officially a fan of his ! Hey, Red Rider ! If you're 
            listening, call me for an interview, will ya !?
        </b><br>
        She asked with a playful wink.
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout the city, everyone cheered for Yusei's unprecedented victory over Sergey. The people in both the Tops and Commons alike roared with amazement. Soon they all began to chant. 
    </p>

    <p><b>People of City: Red Rider ! Red Rider ! Red Rider !</b></p>

    <p>In his room, Jack Atlas smiled to himself.</p>
    
    <p><b>Jack: "Red Rider", huh ? I think I've finally found a worthy opponent.</b></p>

    <p>With the Riding Duel now over, the hologram walls vanished and Yugo and Rin were able to rejoin with Yusei.</p>

    <p><b>Yugo: Yusei ! You did it, man ! You've defeated the Duelist Crusher ! Totally awesome !</b><br>Yugo praised.</p>

    <p><b>Rin: You're incredible, Yusei ! I think you might actually be on par with Jack Atlas himself !</b><br>Rin added. Yusei smiled back.</p>

    <p><b>Perhaps. But now, we can finally get back to leaving…</b></p>

            Sergey: No ! You have suffered no pain ! I cannot allow this displeasure !
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>The trio looked behind them to see Sergey catching up to them again.</p>

    <p><b>Sergey: Come, let us experience the pain and destruction together !</b></p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Come on ! Hasn't that sick bastard had enough for one night !?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Yugo protested in annoyance. Sergey laughed maniacally as he speed up and rammed into Yusei, who couldn't dodge it in time. To their horror, Sergey was trying to push 
        Yusei off the side of the bridge, which they had just now started crossing !
    </p>

    <p><b>Rin: No ! Yusei ! Sergey's going to kill him !</b><br>Rin cried out.</p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yugo: Actually, from the way that bastard talked, I think he plans for both of them to go down ! But hell if I let that happen ! HANG ON RIN !
        </b><br>
        Yugo warned as he sped to catch up with Yusei and Sergey.
    </p>

    <p><b>Rin: Yugo ! What're you doing !?</b></p>

    <p>Rin yelled, holding on to him for dear life. Yugo didn't answer, trying to focus all his attention on saving their new friend.</p>

    <p>
        As hard as he tried, Yusei couldn't break free. He cursed for letting this happen. Sergey continued his insane laughter as they neared the edge.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Sergey: YES !! NOW THIS SHALL BE BEAUTIFUL !!!</b>

    </p>

    <p>
        Just as they were both about to go over, Yugo rammed his D-Wheel into Sergey's to force him away from Yusei. This collision instead caused all three vehicles to fly 
        off the bridge at the same time !
    </p>
    
    <p>
        During the free fall, Sergey did separate from them, still laughing as he fell. Yusei, seeing Yugo and Rin now falling beside him, reached out to them with his right 
        hand. Yugo then reached out with his left. The moment Yusei grabbed Yugo, a few things happened all at once.
    </p>

    <p>
        First, a <a class="imag card"><i>red mark shaped like a Dragon's head</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Yusei_Dragon_Head.jpg" style="height: 250px;"></span></a> 
        started glowing on Yusei's right arm. Then <a class="imag card"><i>Yugo's eyes glowed green</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Yugo_berserk.png" style="height: 250px;"></span></a> 
        and began to scream in pain. Rin's bracelet began to glow bright green as well as she continued to hold on to Yugo. And lastly, all three were consumed by a massive 
        <a class="imag card"><i>crimson colored dragon</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Capture2.PNG"></span></a> that came out of the sky…
    </p>

    <p><center>And then… all was quiet. They were gone.</center></p>
