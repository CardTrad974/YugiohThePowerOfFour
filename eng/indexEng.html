    <div>
        <p>
            This is a personal project of mine. It's a simple story that I've adapted so that it's interactive for everyone who reads it.
        </p>

        <p>In addition, I'll detail several points:</p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First: Concerning the story, it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction" target="_blank">Fanfiction</a>, to be more precise.
                </li><br>

                <li>
                    Second: This Fanfiction is based on the anime, as well as the famous playing card game, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!" target="_blank">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a>". So, for all the fans of this franchise, 
                    I hope you enjoy this story. As well as for anyone else who is just curious about this project.
                </li><br>

                <li>
                    Third: About the content of this story, I will insist on it. First of all, I'm not, in any way, the author of this story. The real author is named 
                    <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/389751/GamingGuy84" target="_blank"><b><u>GamingGuy84</u></b></a>, from the website: 
                    <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/" target="_blank"><b><u>Fanfiction.net</u></b></a>. It turns out that this story is written in English. Also, 
                    this project has to share this work, and to propose you a French version of this story. Therefore, I repeat, but if you begin to appreciate this work, then 
                    I hope that these merits naturally go to it's main author: <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/u/389751/GamingGuy84" target="_blank"><b><u>GamingGuy84</u></b></a>, 
                    who, without him, I might not have had this project idea.<br><br>

                    Also, I give you the link to the original story.<br>
                    <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13257576/1/Yugioh-The-Power-of-Four" target="_blank"><b><u>Click Here</u></b></a>
                </li>
                
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Now, about it's content. Here are some elements I inserted to make the story interactive.</p>

        <p>
            At some points, you'll have audio content. It's simply a background music to help you imagine what the scene is like. Of course, it is up to you if if you want to 
            listen, or if you want to read in the calm and silence. The choice is yours. So, for those who want to listen, here is an example of how it will how it will happen.
        </p>

        <center id="zone1">
            <audio id="audioPlayer" controls src="../disclm/10 Seconds Timer with Music.mp4" type="audio/mpeg">Votre navigateur ne supporte pas la balise audio.</audio><br><br>
        </center>

        <p>Play the audio at the top. Then scroll down the page please.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 50px;">
            .<br>
            .<br>
            .<br>
            .<br>
            .<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            As you can see, the audio bar remains fixed at the top. Also, some music will be played again when they reach the end. Don't worry about it. Since you'll probably 
            switch from one music to another, just pause the music so that it can return to its original position. Try it.
        </p>

        <hr size="1" noshade="">

        <p>Then you will notice that some words will be in a particular font. Here is an example.</p>

        <p>Please hover this word: <a class="imag card"><i>Test</i><span><img alt="toto" src="../disclm/le-mot-test-ecrit-en-lettres-de-tuile-isole-sur-un-fond-blanc-hb6g21.jpg" style="height: 350px; margin-left: 100px"></span></a></p>
        
        <p>
            As you can see, if you hover the words in this font, you will see an image appear. I did this so that you know who or what you are reading about it. Feel free to 
            hover it again.
        </p>

        <hr size="1" noshade="">

        <p>
            We continue, you'll also see a button with a speaker image on it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Please click on it.

            <span id="intSound">

                <audio id="audio1" src="../disclm/Technology Background Template 1080Copyright free Intro template Full HD with soundFree video.mp3"></audio>
                <a onclick="playSound1();"><button><img src="../disclm/Speaker_Icon.svg" alt="hautparleur" style="height: 16px; width: 16px;"></button></a>
                
            </span>
        
        </p>

        <p>
            It's also an audio content that you can listen to by clicking this button. This has been designed especially to listen to certain dialogues. Feel free to force it 
            if you need to.
        </p>

        <!-- <img src="../disclm/37659985.jpg" alt="warning" style: width="25%" style="border: 1px solid red;"> -->

        <!-- <p>
            Currently, if you are going to read this story, it happens that these audio contents will play automatically. Sorry for the inconvenience. For this reason, you'll need to 
            download this extension: <b>Disable HTML5 Autoplay (Reloaded)</b>. I give you the link to download it.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disable-html5-autoplay-re/cafckninonjkogajnihihlnnimmkndgf" target="_blank">For Google Chrome Browser</a>.<br>
            <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/disable-autoplay/" target="_blank">For Mozilla Firefox Browser</a>.
        </p> -->

        <hr size="1" noshade="">

        <p>And finally, the last function. You just have to press it to display a content that has been hidden (Image or Video). Try it out.</p>

        <div id="DisImg1">

            <img alt="toto" src="../disclm/le-mot-test-ecrit-en-lettres-de-tuile-isole-sur-un-fond-blanc-hb6g21.jpg" style="height: 350px; margin-left: 100px"></span></a>
    
        </div>
    
        <button type="button" onclick="show1()" id="btnID1">
            Click Me
        </button>

        <hr size="1" noshade="">

        <p></p>
            
        <p>
