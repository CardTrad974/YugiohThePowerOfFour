        <b>Student: W-What is that?!</b><br>
        One of the younger students asked, sounding afraid. Judai decided to come to Astral's defense.

        Astral said, indicating the various seats on the ship.

    <p>
        As soon as everyone was seated, Astral moved the airship into the sky and a bright flash illuminated on the big screen in front. As the flash faded, the group saw 
        swirling stars in a vast blackness as they passed by.

        As the students discussed among themselves where Judai and Astral were taking them, Serena silently pulled Judai into a private section so they couldn't be overheard.

        Judai and everyone else beamed down to their destination. They were on an huge island, where they saw large forests covering half of it, while a volcano and a rocky 
        valley occupy the other side. There was also a lake with streams that run out into the open ocean. Near the center of the island was a big building near the center. 
        It comprised of a big silver dome surrounded by dark yellow pillars with smaller domes of blue, yellow, and red.

    <p>
        Sitting in his office, a middle aged bald man with a sort grey beard was busy with paperwork. He sighed, wishing things could be a little more interesting this year. 
        Ever since Yuki Judai and most of his friends had graduated, Duel Academy had gotten a little dull. He missed that boy and hoped he was doing well.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        At the moment, he was expecting a certain former student to show up for a teaching assistant position. She was still too young to be a full fledged teacher yet, but 
        this would certainly get her feet wet, as the saying goes.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>???: Maybe this year, we may have a student or two that would surprise us and exceed expectations. Who knows?</b><br>
        He sighed again, talking to himself.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>???: I wouldn't mind having a little excitement around here. But, alas, there won't be another like...</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        The man, Samejima, looked up in surprise to see the very person he was about to name.
    </p>

    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Samejima/Samejima5.png" style="width: 20%; height: 20%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;">
        <b> : J-Judai-kun !?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        He nearly shouted as he stood straight up. He couldn't believe his eyes. It truly was the former Osiris Red student he admired so much. He was standing just outside 
        his office door.
    </p>

        <b> : Sure is! This isn't a bad time, is it?</b><br><br>
        Samejima shook his head as he beckoned the young man inside.
    </p>

    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Samejima/Samejima6.png" style="width: 20%; height: 20%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;">
        <b> : Of course not! Come in, dear boy! Welcome back!</b><br><br>

        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Samejima/Samejima1.png" style="width: 20%; height: 20%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;">
        <b> : Things just haven't been same around here since you left. Rather quiet, actually. I take it you have been busy post-graduation?</b>
    </p>

    <p>He asked, looking happy to see his former pupil.</p>

    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Judai/Judai1.png" style="width: 16%; height: 16%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;">
        <b> : Oh, you have no idea.</b><br><br>Judai vaguely said with a laugh. Samejima laughed with him.

        The older man became more business like.

        <b> : What brings you back to your old school, Judai-kun ?</b><br><br>
        Judai chuckled a bit.

        He then proceeded to tell Samejima about his recent adventures in the Fusion Dimension and the people he brought with him, including Serena. Samejima was intrigued by 
        every detail, especially hearing that one of the escapees was an alternate version of Asuka Tenjoin. That one really surprised him. However, he hated hearing the parts 
        where how students were treated at that other school. He felt total disgust toward Leo Akaba and despised how other people had suffered because of him.

    <p>At Judai's word, Yusho and Asuka led their students inside. Samejima shook hands with Yusho.</p>

    </p>

    <p>
        Samejima was shocked at how strongly this Asuka resembled the one that was taught here. Even her voice sounded the same. If Judai hadn't told him ahead of time, he 
        would've thought that this was the Asuka he had been expecting today. He tried his best not to show how he felt.

        The young girl confirmed as she too shook Samejima's hand.

    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Samejima/Samejima6.png" style="width: 20%; height: 20%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;">

        Serena thought that over in her mind. All she ever knew was to be a soldier to duel for the Arc Area Project. This was something she was originally proud of doing. 
        Since learning of Leo Akaba's real plans for her and got away from him, Serena became uncertain of what she would do. Now this man, Samejima, who seemed like the exact 
        opposite of Leo, offered her a new path. All her life she wanted to prove her worth as a Duelist, something she now knew meant nothing to her former Professor. 
        Samejima actually cared about her and wanted to guide her to her new destiny. Serena looked at him and smiled.

        Judai said excitedly as he led the group through the door.

    <p>Everyone was awestruck. They felt like they had just stepped into fancy hotel suite. There was even a luxurious bathroom.</p>

    <p><b>Student: Whoever did this had to have some cash to burn.</b><br>The red haired girl said in awe. Judai nodded, telling her it was.</p>

        The yellow colored building was not only much bigger than then the previous dorm, but it also was a much more welcoming sight. Compared to Osiris Red, this place looked like a mini mansion.

        The food was great, the bathrooms were nice, and the bedrooms seemed much more comfortable. Most of the students were definitely far more impressed with this dorm than 
        the previous. In fact, Ra Yellow appeared very homey. Serena herself thought it seemed fine. She wondered why Judai turned down a chance to stay here.

        After exploring the dorm, the students were reluctant to leave, especially knowing where they would be going to next. After some coercing from Yusho, the group finally

    <p>
        Despite their reassurances from Samejima and Judai, none of the students want to venture into the highest ranked dorms. Judai, Yusho, and Asuka could tell they really 
        want nothing to do with anything that remotely reminded them of Leo Akaba's personal elite soldiers who were sadistic and cruel. They began to worry if they would even 
        fear the students living there. If only there was someone that could truly convince them that Obelisk Blue and its occupants weren't evil...

        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Judai/Judai6.png" style="width: 16%; height: 16%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;">
        <b> : Hey Rei. Can you help me out with something?</b>
    </p>

    <p>At once, the younger girl became ecstatic again.</p>

    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Rei/Rei2.png" style="width: 16%; height: 16%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;">
        <b> : Sure, Judai! Anything! What do you need?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        He then explained to her about how the other new students he brought felt about Obelisk Blue. She was shocked at the reasons why they hated the Obelisk name so much 
        and wanted nothing to do with it.
    </p>

    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Rei/Rei5.png" style="width: 16%; height: 16%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;">
        <b> : Poor kids. I can see how they would feel about it.</b>
    </p>

    <div style="display: inline-flex;">

                     : No kidding. Do you think you can try to convince them that Obelisk Blue isn't bad? You can guide the girls through the girl's dorm while I do the same with 
                    the guys. It would be a big help if you could lend a hand.
                </b><br>
                Judai said. Rei nodded.
            </p>

    </p>

    <p>With that, the group walked back to Alex and his fellow students. At a nod from Judai, Rei spoke to Serena, Alex, and the other students.</p>

                     : Hey again. Listen, Judai just told me about your issues with Obelisk Blue. As a student currently living there, I can promise you that it isn't a terrible 
                    place at all. The girls I know in that dorm are really nice and I'm sure they would treat you all well. As for the boys, they can have a bit of an attitude, but 
                    they are not tyrants. If you guys really don't want to move into Obelisk Blue while attending Duel Academy, that's okay. No one here, including me or Judai, is 
                    forcing you. All I'm saying is that you shouldn't see it as some disease you should avoid. It is just a place for students with high privileges and high dueling

    </div>

    <p>Rei then paused to let all her words sink in the minds of all those apprehensive students.</p>

    <p>
        Everyone looked at one another and whispered among themselves. Rei's words seem to finally ease them regarding the dorm... except for one. Serena, despite all she heard, 
        still looked adamant to stay clear of the dorm. Judai, Rei, Asuka, and Yusho noticed her obvious expression and sighed inwardly. They all could tell that she was truly 
        a stubborn one.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Student: Um... Rei-san ?</b><br>
        Said the girl student with red hair.

    <p><img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Rei/Rei1.png" style="width: 16%; height: 16%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;"><b> : Yeah?</b><br><br>Rei asked hopefully.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Student: After discussing it, me and the rest of us decided to at least see how the dorms are.</b><br>
        She replied. Rei smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Rei/Rei8.png" style="width: 16%; height: 16%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;"><b> : Great! Okay, all the girls can follow me, while the boys follow Judai-sama!</b>
    </p>

    <p>She said as she started leading Asuka and the rest of the girls, until she saw Serena not moving from where she stood.</p>
    
    <p><img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Rei/Rei10.png" style="width: 16%; height: 16%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;"><b> : Are you not coming?</b></p>

        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Serena/Serena9.png" style="width: 14%; height: 14%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;"><b> : No. I will NEVER set foot in there. I'll wait outside.</b>
        <br><br>She said defiantly with her back turned. Rei seemed a little disappointed, but understood.

        <b> : Okay, I get it. You can stay out here. The rest of you ladies, this way.</b><br><br>
        Rei and the girls then walked toward and inside the girl's dorm of Obelisk Blue.

        Judai said as he led the boy students to the other dorm.
    </p>

        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Yusho/Yusho1.png" style="width: 22%; height: 22%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;">
        <b> : Judai, I'll stay here and keep Serena company until everyone comes back.</b><br><br>Yusho said. Judai nodded, understanding the reason.

        <b> : Sure thing, Yusho. Be back in a few, Serena.</b>
    </p>

    <p>As soon as Judai led the boy students inside the dorm building, Yusho faced Serena.</p>

        <b> : Anything named "Obelisk" I want nothing to do with. It just keeps reminding me of the Obelisk Force, and how they were to everyone.</b>

    <p> She hated those guys, and it was not just because Akaba Leo had them prevent Serena from escaping Academia.</p>

        walking toward them. However, they were surprised by a few things when they saw her. First, she didn't come out from the Obelisk Blue girl's dorm, but rather from the 
        direction of the main Duel Academy building. Second, she wore different clothes than she did earlier. Instead of her old school uniform, she wore a light business 
        suit, like she just came from a job interview. Lastly, and most significantly of all, Asuka didn't seem to recognize either one of them.

    <p>Serena said in a tone that made Asuka feel she had said something wrong.</p>

    <p>
        Before she could ask if something was bothering her, they heard some loud conversations coming from the boy's dorm. They turned to see a group of boys coming towards 
        them. Asuka figured they must be some of the students in Yusho's care. That was when she saw who was leading them their way... and immediately felt her heart race.

        <i> : Judai?! Can it really be?</i>
    </p>

    <p>As they came out of the dorm, the boys were discussing how Obelisk Blue was like.</p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Student (1): I really didn't believe it at first, but that place wasn't so bad after all.</b><br>
        Said the green haired boy.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Student (2): That dorm really was like a castle from those old fairy tales. It felt much more fancy and less stuffy like at Academia.</b><br>
        Said another boy who unexpectedly enjoyed the tour.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Alex: The boys in there seem polite enough, but I still not rather live in there. It just seemed too fancy for my tastes.</b><br>
        Alex said.
    </p>

    <p>Judai was pleased that at least the boys no longer feared the highest ranked dorm in the school.</p>

    <p><img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Judai/Judai6.png" style="width: 16%; height: 16%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;"><b> : See, I told you so.</b></p>

    <p>
        He said to them as they made their way back to Yusho and Serena. He saw that Asuka was with them again, but he was surprised that she looked different now and that 
        Rei and the other girls weren't with her. And what's more, she seemed a little flustered and speechless as he approached.
    </p>

        Yusho said as he beckoned the boy a short distance away, just out of earshot. Though stumped, Judai complied and walked with him. Asuka was as confused as Judai was,

        <b> : Judai, listen. That Asuka you were talking to just now... she's the one you know here, in your world.</b>
    </p>

    <p>Judai gasped at once and turned to look at Asuka again.</p>

    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Judai/Judai16.png" style="width: 16%; height: 16%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;">
        <b> : Seriously?! The Asuka I've known for 3 years?! She's... come back here?!</b><br><br>
        He said, totally stunned this. Yusho chuckled.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Yusho/Yusho1.png" style="width: 22%; height: 22%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;">
        <b> : It would seem so. And it also seems that she's <i>very</i> happy to see you.</b><br><br>
        He said with a knowing look. A look that apparently was lost on the boy.
    </p>

    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Judai/Judai4.png" style="width: 16%; height: 16%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;">
        <b> : So that suit... is she like working here now?</b><br><br>Judai asked.
    </p>

    <p><img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Yusho/Yusho1.png" style="width: 22%; height: 22%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;"><b> : Yes, she is.</b></p>

    <p>
        Yusho said, while also telling him that Principal Samjima was ready to have Serena and the rest tested for qualification. This pleased the boy as the duo headed 
        back to the two girls.
    </p>

    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Asuka/Asuka3.png" style="width: 18%; height: 18%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;">
        <b> : What was that about? You two know each other?</b><br><br>Asuka asked. Yusho laughed as he patted Judai on the back.
    </p>

    <div style="display: inline-flex;">
        
        <div style="width: 280px;">
            <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Yusho/Yusho1.png" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;">
        </div>
    
        <span style="margin-top: 7%;">
            <p>
                <b> : We have worked together recently, yes. I was just telling Judai that he should take some time to catch up with an old school friend.</b>
            </p>
        </span>
        
    </div>

    <p>
        He then gave Judai a friendly push forward. He almost knocked her over when he bumped into her. Asuka then felt herself going slightly limp as Judai held himself on 
        her shoulders to try to not to fall on top of her.
    </p>

    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Judai/Judai15.png" style="width: 16%; height: 16%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;">
        <b> : Oh uh, sorry Asuka!</b><br><br>
        Judai apologized quickly, hoping he didn't offend her. Asuka only laughed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Asuka/Asuka5.png" style="width: 18%; height: 18%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;">
        <b> : Don't be. You did nothing wrong.</b><br><br>She assured him.
    </p>

    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Asuka/Asuka1.png" style="width: 18%; height: 18%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;"><b> : So, can we... catch up?</b>
    </p>

    <p>She asked while smiling. Judai smiled back and nodded.</p>

    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Judai/Judai6.png" style="width: 16%; height: 16%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;">
        <b> : Sure. If it's cool with you two.</b><br><br>
        He looked back at Yusho and Serena.
    </p>

    <div style="display: inline-flex;">
        
        <div style="width: 265px;">
            <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Yusho/Yusho1.png" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;">
        </div>
    
        <span style="margin-top: 7%;">
            <p>
                <b> : Don't worry. I'll tell the others about the exams and lead them back to take them. You can drop by later to watch the qualification Duels.</b><br>
                Yusho said.
            </p>
        </span>
        
    </div>

    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Serena/Serena1.png" style="width: 14%; height: 14%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;"><b> : It's fine.</b><br><br>Serena said while shrugging.
    </p>

    <p>
        Though she didn't show it, she didn't like how this other Asuka was behaving around Judai. She acted liked she wanted to be closer to him. Serena didn't know why, but 
        it somehow bothered her...
    </p>

    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Judai/Judai1.png" style="width: 16%; height: 16%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;">
        <b> : Okay, I'll see you duel later Serena! Good luck in the written exams! They're can be... a killer!
        </b><br><br>Judai said as he left with Asuka.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        As he said that, Judai remembered how hard the written exams were. He himself had barely passed. It was the primary reason he ended up in Osiris Red. He was sure 
        Serena would do much better than he did.
    </p>

    <p>While watching the pair walk to chat, Yusho smiled and felt something going on between them.</p>

    <div style="display: inline-flex;">
        
        <div style="width: 245px;">
            <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Yusho/Yusho1.png" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;">
        </div>
    
        <span style="margin-top: 7%;">
            <p>
                <i> : I could tell that this world's Asuka has strong feelings for Judai... but it seems he doesn't know it himself. At least, not yet...</i><br>
                Yusho thought with a smile.
            </p>
        
        </span>
        
    </div>

    <p>He then saw Serena frowning.</p>

    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Yusho/Yusho6.png" style="width: 22%; height: 22%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;"><b> : Anything on your mind?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        He asked her. It was then that Rei was coming back with her own tour group, including the
        <a class="imag card"><i>Asuka</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/de13a8g-9c97ee95-f4d3-4dc7-ac2c-2f40d6d30174.png" style="width: 350px; margin-left: 125px;" ></span></a> 
        she herself knew. She didn't want her insecurities to show themselves to her or anyone else. So instead, Serena smirked and grunted as she tried to look tough.
    </p>

    <p>
        <img alt="toto" src="../common/CharaRenders/Serena/Serena24.png" style="width: 14%; height: 14%; vertical-align: -webkit-baseline-middle;"><b> : What's on my mind... is kicking ass on those qualification exams.</b>
