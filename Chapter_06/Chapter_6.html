    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Edo: Where did this guy come from?! How did he protect Sora from being sealed into a card?! And how in the hell did HE not get carded himself?!
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Edo couldn't answer any of those questions. It was impossible to stop someone from being sealed once the process started. Or rather, it was supposed to be impossible.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a class="imag card"><i>Yuzu</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/FullZuzuBoyle.png" style="height: 550px; margin-left: 125px;"></span></a> and Sora stared dumbfounded at

        They never imagined that he would turn up when they needed help the most. 
    </p>

        <b>, and now he's here to help me and Sora. How did he even know?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Yuzu asked herself, completely bewildered. Sora had similar thoughts, wondering just how he stopped Edo from carding him.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a class="imag card"><i>Yugi Muto</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Yugi_muto.png" style="width: 550px; margin-left: 100px;"></span></a>, now merged with the soul of

        gazed upon the surprised pair he just helped.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Atem (Yami Yugi): Yuzu, Sora, are you two alright?</b><br>
        He asked. Even his voice sounded stronger than normal, surprising them even more.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yuzu: I-I'm okay.</b><br>Yuzu said in a slightly shaky voice.</p>

    <p><b>Sora: I may look a little banged up, but I'll manage.</b></p>

    <p>Sora said as he struggled to get back up. Yuzu quickly moved to help him.</p>

    <p><b>Sora: Thanks for saving me, by the way.</b><br>Yugi smiled.</p>

    <p><b>Atem (Yami Yugi): You are welcome. I should be thanking you for keeping Yuzu out of harms way. Now...</b></p>

    <p>Yugi said as he refocused his attention on Edo.</p>

    <p><b>Atem (Yami Yugi): Yuzu, you take Sora and stay back. I will handle this.</b></p>
    
    <p>Though stunned and confused by his sudden change, Yuzu nodded as she and Sora move to a huge crate beside the warehouse entrance. Edo finally regained his own voice at this point.</p>

    <p><b>Edo: Who are you?! Identify yourself!</b><br>He demanded of his new acquaintance.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Atem (Yami Yugi): I am Muto Yugi, and I've come to stop </b>

    </p>

    <p>Yugi strongly declared as he activated his <a class="imag card"><i>Duel Disk</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Duel_Disk_2.png" style="width: 450px;"></span></a>. 
        The trio present were surprised even further.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yuzu: Yugi's here... to protect <i>me</i>?</b><br>Yuzu asked herself.</p>

    <p><i>Sora: What? How did he know about the Professor's plan? How does he even know about the Professor to begin with?</i></p>

    <p>Sora asked himself in his mind. Edo was just as shocked by Yugi's declaration.</p>

    <p><b>Edo: Protect Yuzu? How do you even know...?</b></p>
    
    <p>Edo then came to a shocking realization as he gasped.</p>

    <p><b>Edo: It's you! <i>You're</i> the Duelist I've been warned about! You are Yuzu's <i>real</i> protector, not Sora!</b></p>

    <p>Edo exclaimed. Yugi's only reply was a confident smile, which infuriated the Commander-In-Chief.</p>

    <p><b>Sora: He what?</b><br>Sora couldn't help but ask aloud. Yuzu was just as stumped as he was.</p>

    <p><b>Atem (Yami Yugi): It's time to duel, Edo! Face me!</b></p>

    <p>Yugi challenged. Edo sneered as he also activated his Duel Disk in response.</p>

    <p><b>Edo: Things may not have gone as planned, but I WILL win in the end! Prepare to be destroyed, Yugi Muto!</b></p>

    <p>The energy could be felt from both combatants as their epic battle began.</p>

    <p>Yugi warned while still smirking.</p>

    <p>Edo gasped in shock. That shock was soon overcome by intense anger.</p>

    <p><i>Edo: That card! It's like the one he used!</i></p>

    <p>
        He recalled a scene from his recent past during a Duel with a man that used a Trap similar to Yugi's. That man was the reason he was so reluctant to leave the Xyz 
        Dimension. If it hadn't been a direct order from the Professor himself, Edo wouldn't be here dealing with a girl he could see no importance to the Arc Area Project. 
        He couldn't believe someone had the nerve to play a card like his! Yuzu was just as surprised, but unlike Edo she had no grudge against the man she knew.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yuzu: Magical Hats? Could it be?</b><br>Yuzu asked herself in wonder. Edo, however, couldn't contain his fury.</p>

    <p><b>Edo: Why do you have that card?! Are you an ally of </b>

    <p>Edo furiously demanded. Yuzu gasped loudly and covered her mouth.</p>

    <p><b>Yuzu: Did he say Yusho Sakaki?! Edo knows Yuya's father?!</b></p>
    
    <p>She asked herself, shocked by the revelation. No one had seen Yuya's missing father for three whole years. Yuzu wondered if Edo knew where he was.</p>

    <p><b>Sora: Sakaki?</b></p>

    <p>Sora questioned, surprised hearing that Edo knew someone with the same last name as Yuya.</p>

    <p><b>Atem (Yami Yugi): I haven't had the pleasure of meeting him. Although, I'll admit I am a fan of his work.</b></p>

    <p>Yugi answered, angering Edo even more.</p>

    <p><b>Yuzu: Yugi is good.</b><br>Yuzu said in amazement. She wished Yuya were here to see this.</p>

    <p><b>Sora: Yeah, really good. But will he actually win?</b></p>

    <p>
        Sora asked, still not certain Yugi can take down Academia's Commander-In-Chief. True, while Yugi seemed prepared for anything Edo can throw at him, he still had yet to 
        Summon a Monster strong enough to defeat Dystopiaguy. Plus, he had no more cards in his hand. If he didn't draw something good on his next turn, he could be done for. 
        Yugi and Atem thought the same thing.
    </p>

    <p><i>Yugi: Mou Hitori no Boku, we have to draw the card we need to win the Duel now!</i><br>Yugi said in his thoughts.</p>

    <p>
        One of them said before he and his comrades were beaten to a pulp by 
        “<a class="imag card monsterN" ><i>Elemental HERO Neos</i><span><img class="resize_card" alt="toto" src="img/ElementalHERONeos-SDHS-EN-C-UE.png"/></span></a> ". 
        Several more were hit by a sparkling energy blast from the mouth of 
        “<a class="imag card monsterS" ><i>Stardust Dragon</i><span><img class="resize_card" alt="toto" src="img/StardustDragon-TOCH-EN-CR-1E.png"/></span></a> ”. 
        All the remaining soldiers were slashed by the blades of 
        “<a class="imag card monsterXYZ" ><i>Number 39: Kibo O Hope</i><span><img class="resize_card" alt="toto" src="img/Utopia2.png"/></span></a> ”. 
        Within seconds, the whole Obelisk Force was wiped out and automatically disappeared in blue sparkles, sending them back to Academia. The trio of Monsters had vanished 
        by that point. Edo was more dumbstruck than ever.
    </p>

    <p><b>Judai: Oï! Yugi-san! We late to the party?</b></p>

    <p>
        Yugi turned to see <a class="imag card"><i>Yuki Judai</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/ddg84ua-02d600ad-dc7f-4cdf-b510-c1916324803a.png" style="width: 450px; margin-left: 125px;" ></span></a>, 
        <a class="imag card"><i>Fudo Yusei</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/dco3yuo-c4f86cbe-3808-410b-a841-7202ed214a37.png" style="height: 350px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a> and 
        <a class="imag card"><i>Tsukumo Yuma</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/df443cy-d199183b-ca42-419f-8071-e44122be0436.png" style="height: 450px;"></span></a> meeting up 
        with him, smiling. Yugi too smiled as he gave a thumbs up.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Atem (Yami Yugi): Actually, your timing couldn't be more perfect! Thank you!</b>
    </p>

    <p>The trio nodded in return, glad they made it in time.</p>

    <p><b>Atem (Yami Yugi): Are the others safe?</b></p>

    <p>He asked. The trio knew who he meant.</p>
    
    <p><b>Yuma: They're both safe and sound!</b><br>Yuma said proudly.</p>

    <p><b>Yusei: Same here.</b><br>Yusei added.</p>

    <p><b>Judai: She's also safe.</b><br>Judai said, also with a thumbs up.</p>

    <p><b>Sora: Who are these guys?</b><br>Sora asked, still stunned.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Yuzu: Yugi seems to know them. They must be friends of his.</b><br>
        Yuzu guessed, judging by how they interacted.
    </p>

    <p><b>Edo: What's the meaning of this?!</b></p>

    <p>Edo shouted in outrage. Yugi turned back to him and, as he did so, lifted his Duel Disk to point to it's center.</p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Atem (Yami Yugi): As I previously stated, I like to plan ahead. On my way here to confront you and protect Yuzu, I sent a distress signal to my friends here to 
            give me a helping hand! I suspected Leo Akaba would have a plan to use the Obelisk Force to give you an unfair advantage, so... I wanted to have my own backup to deal 
            with yours!
        </b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Edo was shocked that Yugi actually thought that far ahead. To prove it, his friends showed their own Duel Disks, each having a blinking red light in the center. Edo 
        cursed under his breath at this.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yuzu: Your Professor really is a heartless monster, isn't he?!</b><br>Yuzu yelled back.</p>

    <p><b>Edo: You know nothing!</b><br>Edo protested, but Yugi wouldn't have it as he spoke again.</p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Atem (Yami Yugi): But I know everything, Edo! I even know the reason why Leo wants to capture Yuzu so much! A reason he did not share with anyone else!
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>This got everyone's attention.</p>

    <p><b>Sora: He knows why the Professor is after Yuzu?</b></p>

    <p>Sora asked softly. Yuzu gasped when she heard this too.</p>

    <p><b>Edo: What reason?</b></p>
    
    <p>
        Edo asked reluctantly. Despite his anger and frustration, he remained curious as to why the girl was so important to the Professor. If Yugi knew, maybe he could find 
        out. The answer Yugi was about to give left Edo, Sora, and Yuzu in horrified shock.

    <p>
        <b>
            Atem (Yami Yugi): Akaba Leo lost someone very important to him, and he plans to use Yuzu to bring back that person. However, the method he plans to do so will cost 
            Yuzu her own life! I'm here to make sure that doesn't happen!
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Yuzu began to pale and her body began to tremble. This Professor, Leo Akaba, plans to kill her?! Just so he could resurrect someone he lost?! She almost felt like 
        throwing up. Sora's jaw had dropped and stared at Yuzu in renewed worry and panic. Edo's eyes widened with disbelief.
    </p>

    <p><b>Edo: That... can't be true. That's just another one of your lies!</b></p>

    <p>Edo said stubbornly. He could never imagine the Professor doing something like that.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Atem (Yami Yugi): Everything I have told you was the truth. You just need to accept it and see through the wrongness of Leo Akaba's actions.</b><br>
        Yugi said. At this point, his allies stepped up next to him.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Judai: Yeah man, Leo's the real villain here. I actually know someone back where I came from that was misled just like you were. He saw how wrong he had been. I know you can open your eyes too.
        </b><br>
        Judai had said, thinking of the <a class="imag card"><i>Edo Phoenix</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/dciuzpl-2217a9f2-552d-4a40-afd0-8285280001ca.png" style="height: 750px; margin-left: 100px"></span></a> 
        of his world.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: It's not too late for you. You can still do the right thing.</b><br>
        Yusei persisted.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>
            Yuma: Totally! There's nothing wrong with using Duels to make people smile and feel happy! Yusho would've wanted that too. It's what he wanted for the all people 
            he taught, including a certain someone that I met recently.
        </b><br>
        Yuma said with Dennis on his mind.
    </p>

    <p>
        Edo seemed more conflicted than ever. Deep inside, he wrestled with what he learned from the Professor and what Yusho Sakaki was trying to teach him. And now, Yugi and 
        is friends actually tipped the scale more towards the latter. Also, what he heard about the Professor's desire with capturing Yuzu had cast some doubt about his 
        objectives. He just didn't know what to do.
    </p>

    <p>Defeated and confused, Edo pushed another button on his Duel Disk and disappeared like the Obelisk Force did. He had retreated.</p>

    <p><b>Judai: He's gone.</b><br>Judai said.</p>

    <p><b>Atem (Yami Yugi): Perhaps, but at least now he has plenty to think over.</b></p>

    <p>Yugi replied, sounding hopeful. He then introduced his friends to Yuzu and Sora.</p>

        <b>
            Atem (Yami Yugi): Yuzu, Sora, these are my friends and allies: Judai Yuki, Yusei Fudo, and Yuma Tsukumo. The four of us have been working together against Academia, and 
            Akaba Leo.
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>Each of his friends said hi to the pair.</p>
    
    <p><b>Yuzu: It is nice to meet all of you. Thanks for saving us, especially you Yugi.</b><br>Yuzu said politely.</p>

    <p><b>Sora: Yeah, thanks. I'm just surprised you'd help save someone like me. I'm also with Academia you know.</b></p>

    <p><b>Atem (Yami Yugi): That doesn't matter. The fact that you were willing to protect Yuzu despite knowing how Academia will react toward you showed you truly cared about her.</b></p>

    <p>Yugi said, making the younger boy look away, uncertain of his future.</p>

    <p>
        Above them on the warehouse roof, Dennis had seen and heard the whole thing. After leaving Yuri at their rendezvous point to wait for Edo's signal, Dennis headed back to see how things were 
        going. He had returned just as Yugi defeated Edo in their Duel. He was very shocked that the plan had gone completely down the drain.
    </p>

    <p>
        He too began to question himself after hearing about Yugi's accusations, the Professor's plans for Yuzu and especially what Yuma said about Yusho Sakaki. He needed 
        time for himself to think, but first he needed to inform Yuri on this latest debacle. He then silently left to return to the rendezvous point.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unbeknownst to Dennis, one member of Yugi's group did spot him spying from above. Being one of the only invisible people there, 
        <a class="imag card"><i>Astral</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/df44394-4358f8e5-0910-4421-a233-b0518321c985.png" style="height: 550px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a> 
        was glad he had that benefit... aside from Pharaoh Atem that is.
    </p>

    <p><i>Astral: We should get moving. I saw Dennis watching us and has just retreated.</i><br>He informed his friends.</p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Atem (Yami Yugi): He must be on his way to find Yuri. Edo did say he called him to come here for Yuzu.</b><br>
        Yugi pointed out.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yuzu: Who is on his way? What do you mean?</b></p>

    <p>Yuzu asked, both her and Sora looking confused.</p>

    <p><b>Judai: Oh yeah, that's right. You guys can't see him. Well, we'll get that cleared up pretty soon.</b><br>Judai said.</p>

    <p><b>Sora: Qui est-ce qu'on ne peut pas voir ?</b></p>

    <p><b>Yusei: Another friend of ours. Only the four of us can see him, but you'll meet him before long. Right now, we need to go and...</b></p>

    <p>Before Yusei could finish what he was saying, an unforeseen development had just occurred that alerted everyone.</p>

    <p>
        Without warning, Yuzu's <a class="imag card"><i>bracelet</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Yuzu'sBracelet.png"></span></a> had started blinking pink light. This really surprised Yuzu and Sora.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Sora: What's up with your bracelet?</b><br>Sora asked. A startled Yuzu shook her head, completely baffled.</p>

    <p><b>Yuzu: I don't know. It's never done that before. Why is it doing that?</b></p>

    <p>
        She then looked up to ask Yugi if he knew, but the look he had told her it wasn't a good thing. It was not just him. Judai, Yusei, Yuma, and even Astral 
        (whom she couldn't see) looked extremely alarmed.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yuzu: What's wrong Yugi?</b></p>

    <p>Demanda Yuzu, qui semblait maintenant effrayée. Lui et ses amis se sont regardés et ont su instantanément ce que cela signifiait.</p>

    <p><b>Atem (Yami Yugi): Yuzu, do you know if Yuya is still at his house?</b></p>

    <p>Yugi asked urgently. This question stunned her and Sora.</p>

    <p><b>Yuzu: Yuya? What's Yuya got to do with my bracelet?</b></p>
    
    <p>What he said to her made her panic more than she had ever felt in her life.</p>

    <p><b>Atem (Yami Yugi): I'm afraid that Yuya... is in terrible danger.</b></p>
