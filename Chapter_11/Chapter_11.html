        a tall young man with spiked up blond hair and wearing white and gray riding clothes, observed

        behavior with an apparent look of disapproval. He showed up at the penthouse just in time to see the two teens fall into the pool and started splashing one another. 
        He didn't show it, but he was taking great pleasure at their reaction from seeing him.
    </p>

    <p>
        As if the water had suddenly grown too hot, Yugo and Rin scrambled out of the pool and then bowed before the man they idolized, dripping wet and eyes closed.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Rin: ack Atlas! King of Riding Duels! W-We, that is Yugo and I, a-are... s-so honored to meet you, sir!
        </b><br>
        Rin said in a rushed greeting, still visibly embarrassed.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yugo: Y-Yeah! Rin and I, see... the thing is, we uh... never thought we'd meet you... like this! This is DEFINITELY not h-how we expected to...
        </b><br>
        Yugo followed, sounding like a boy caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Jack: Enough! Stand up straight, both of you!</b><br>
        Jack commanded.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo and Rin: Yes sir!</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        At his word, the two straightened themselves up, eyes open, and both still scared out of their skins and soaked. 
        <br><a class="imag card"><i>Yusei</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/dco3yuo-c4f86cbe-3808-410b-a841-7202ed214a37.png" style="height: 350px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a> 
        and the twins stayed back and didn't say anything as they watched the fun. Jack then started walking around Yugo and Rin, still scrutinizing the pair. Neither one of 
        them dared to speak but gulped as they followed the man with their fearful eyes. Jack stopped in front of them, his expression not changing in the slightest.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Jack: Yugo and Rin, Yusei has informed me about you two and your situation. First off, let me make something perfectly clear. While we have many similarities, I am not the </b>

            that King! Is that understood?!
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo and Rin: Yes sir!</b><br>
        Said the flustered teens again.
    </p>

    <p>
        After a long moment of silence, Jack now smiled, secretly enjoying watching them squirm. When he spoke, he sounded much calmer.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Jack: Very good. Now then, any questions?</b><br>
        He asked.
    </p>

    <p>Rin was the first to speak up, still sounding a bit squeaky.</p>

    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: I, um... I have a question, sir.</b><br>
        Rin said, her voice trembling.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Jack: Ask Rin.</b><br>
        Jack simply said.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: H-How... do you and Yusei... know each other?</b><br>
        She barely managed to say.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Instead of answering, Jack pulled up the sleeve of his right arm and showed it to the duo. Yugo and Rin gasped; it was a

        like the ones Yusei and the others had. In Jack's case, it appeared to be a pair of dragon wings.
    </p>

        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Jack said the last bit in a low tone, further embarrassing the two. Another moment of uncomfortable silence followed before Yugo finally had the nerve to talk.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Um... Mr. King, Jack, uh...</b><br>
        He started, rather badly.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Jack: Boy! You will address me as either Jack or sir! Got that?</b><br>
        He shouted again.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Y-Yes, sir! Anyway, about my question...</b><br>
        Yugo started again, but stopped.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Jack: Yes?</b><br>Jack asked impatiently. Yugo gulped once more he resumed talking.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yugo: Jack Atlas... I wanted to duel you... that is, the you in our world…for a long time. So um... what I want to know is... 
        </b><br>
        Yugo took a deep breath and let it out.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Can we... please have a Duel?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Rin gapped at Yugo. She didn't think he'd actually dare challenge Jack Atlas like this. He may not be the one they admired, but he had to still be the best here. She 
        wanted to berate him for it, but she didn't dare do so with Jack around.
    </p>

    <p>
        As for Jack himself, he narrowed his eyes and walked closer to Yugo until he was right in front of him only. Yugo felt like he shrunk under the older man's gaze.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Jack: So, you wish to duel me Yugo?</b><br>
        He asked softly, making the boy sweat.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Yes sir, I do.</b><br>
        Yugo answered, trying to keep his voice steady.
    </p>

    <p>
        Jack said nothing, still staring at Yugo. He appeared to be sizing him up. Then, to the great surprise of Yugo and Rin, Jack laughed. The two looked confused. When he 
        ceased laughing a moment later, he pointed at himself.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Jack: I, Jack Atlas, don't accept challenges from just anyone! I only duel those I judge to be worth my time, and I would prefer them to be more on the... dry side.
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Jack emphasized, seeing water still dripping from Yugo's hair and clothes. This made Yugo grimace a bit. He was starting to think he won't get the chance, when...
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Jack: However...</b><br>Jack continued.</p>

    <p><b>Jack: If you truly wish to face me in a Duel, then you must prove yourself.</b></p>

    <p><b>Yugo: How? I'll do anything!</b><br>Yugo said, now starting to feel hopeful.</p>

    <p><b>Jack: You do possess your own D-Wheel, do you not?</b></p>

    <p><b>Yugo: Yes sir, I do!</b><br>Yugo answered. Jack then smirked.</p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Jack: Then I want you to duel my fellow Signer, Crow Hogan. And not just any Duel... but a Riding Duel! If you can best him, then I might consider dueling against 
            you. If not... I would not want to waste any more of my precious time with someone who thinks he has what it takes to take on the King! Especially when that someone 
            doesn't have the common sense to wear dry clothes in my presence! Do you accept these terms, boy?!
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Yugo couldn't believe his luck! An opportunity to prove himself to duel the Riding Duel King himself! He just had to beat Crow, which soon became a dilemma. He and 
        Crow had just started becoming friends, and now Jack Atlas wanted the two of them to go head-to-head. Still, he couldn't let this pass up.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Hell yes! Um, I mean... yes, I accept, sir!</b><br>
        Yugo said corrected himself after the stern look Jack gave him. The older Duelist nodded after a moment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>
            Jack: Very well, then. Yusei will help prepare you for the upcoming Duel. I will go and tell Crow to also get ready. The match will began in two hours. Do NOT be late.
        </b><br>
        Jack said while walking away.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Oh, trust me Jack! I'll be there! You won't be sorry!</b><br>
        Yugo shouted at the man.
    </p>

    <p><b>Jack: But before I leave... I want a quick word with you, Yusei.</b><br>Jack said just before he went inside.</p>

    <p><b>Yusei: Of course.</b><br>Yusei said as he followed him.</p>

    <p>As soon as they were inside, Rin let out a breath of relief, while Yugo shouted for joy.</p>

    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: YES!!! Did you hear that Rin?! I have a chance to duel Jack Atlas! Isn't that awesome?!</b>
    </p>

    <p>Instead of answering, Rin frowned at him.</p>

    <p><b>Yugo: W-What? What is it Rin ?</b></p>
    
    <p>
        <b>
            Rin: ugo, I honestly can't believe you would challenge him like that. I'm even more surprised he'd actually give you that chance. I mean, we weren't exactly 
            expecting him to drop in on us like that! Which reminds me...
        </b><br>
        Rin then rounded on the twins, who backed up a little.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Rin: You both KNEW about Jack Atlas, didn't you?! You two, Yusei, Crow, and Aki all knew and none of you told us!
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Rin then remembered something. Last night, Yusei said Yugo had been sleeping in Jack's room. She had thought it was some other guy named Jack at the time. She never would've thought he meant the King's room!
    </p>

    <p><b>Rua: Look Rin, Jack made us all swear not to say anything to you and Yugo until he met you both himself! It wasn't our idea!</b><br>Rua explained nervously.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Ruka: It's the truth. Please, calm down Rin.</b><br>
        Ruka begged, also cowering from the older girl's anger. Eventually, Rin did settle down before turning back to Yugo.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Aren't you upset about this?</b><br>
        She demanded. Yugo shrugged.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yugo: Not really. I mean, sure, I didn't think Yusei and his friends were also buddies with Jack Atlas. Hell, I don't even know how there could be more than one 
            Jack in existence! But so what? It doesn't change the fact that I might duel him soon!
        </b><br>
        He said with excitement.
    </p>

    <p><b>Rin: You do know that you have to beat Crow first, don't you?</b><br>She asked.</p>
    
    <p><b>Yugo: Yeah, I know.</b><br>Yugo replied.</p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Rin: Then you need to take this more seriously. If dueling Rua has taught me one thing, it's that you should NEVER underestimate a Signer! Crow may be as strong as Yusei.
        </b><br>
        She warned.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Who said I wasn't taking this seriously?! Trust me Rin, I've got this!</b><br>
        His friend sighed in defeat while shaking her head.
    </p>

    <p>When both adult Signers were alone and out of sight, Jack laughed.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Jack: So? How do you think I did out there?</b><br>
        Jack asked, now sounding much more relaxed than he did outside.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: I think you gave Yugo and Rin quite a scare.</b><br>
        Yusei said, smiling a little. Jack looked proud of himself for the performance he just gave.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Jack: As they should be, considering who stood towering over them.</b><br>
        Jack then smiled at his rival and friend.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Jack: I had a damn good time out there intimidating those kids. Thanks for not telling them about me, and for letting me have some fun.</b><br>
        He said sincerely.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Sure, although you could've gone a little softer on Yugo when you kept bringing up how soaking wet he was.</b><br>
        Yusei said. Jack then grunted, ignoring that last part.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Jack: What about you? You sure you don't want to tell them that...</b><br>
        Jack started.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yusei: There's no need for them to know. I never really cared about taking your title as King at the Fortune Cup. It will be fine that they think you are the King here.
        </b><br>
        Yusei said, sounding humble. Jack sighed as he patted Yusei's shoulder.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Jack: Fudo Yusei...  the humblest person I know.</b><br>
        With that, Jack headed out to inform Crow about his upcoming Duel with Yugo.

    <p>
        Two hours later, everyone met at a basic looking racing track. Yugo and Rin (in dry clothes now) arrived just in time with Yusei, Rua, and Ruka accompanying them. At 
        the starting line stood Jack and Crow, the latter prepping his D-Wheel for the Riding Duel. Aki was also there, having heard of the Duel from Ruka. She sat in the 
        stands, waving at Yugo's group with a smile.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Jack: So Yugo, you have arrived.</b><br>Jack said. Yugo smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: That's right Jack! I told you I would be!</b><br>The older Duelist snorted.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Jack: Try to impress me.</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        ack said boringly as he stood aside, allowing the boy to get his 
        <a class="imag card"><i>DWheel</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Yugo's_Duel_Runner.png" style="width: 550px;"></span></a>, in position next to

        the others.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Wish me luck!</b><br>
        He said before proceeding out onto the track.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Good luck Yugo!</b><br>
        Rin shouted, though she still felt apprehensive about this.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yusei: Yugo will do fine.</b><br>Yusei assured her. Rin nodded, but still worried.</p>

    <p><b>Ruka: Do your best Yugo!</b><br>Ruka shouted.</p>

    <p><b>Rua: Show Crow what you're made of!</b><br>Rua added.</p>

    <p>
        Jack then sat to Yusei's left, while Aki was on the right. Rin and the twins were all sitting on Aki's right. Rin still felt slightly nervous that Jack sat so close.

    <p><b>Jack: I've told Crow not to hold back against the boy. If Yugo really does want to face me, he'll have to do the same.</b></p>
    
    <p><b>Yusei: Yugo is a talented Riding Duelist. I'm sure he'll surprise you.</b></p>

    <p><b>Aki: I can't wait to see what he can do.</b><br>Aki replied. Jack said nothing as he waited for the match to start.</p>

    <p>Down at the track, Yugo and Crow greeted one another with a fist bump.</p>

    <p><b>Crow: Hey Yugo! You ready for this?</b><br>Crow asked with a big smile.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Hell yeah, I am! Even with the changes to my Deck, I'm confident I can kick your ass!</b><br>
        Yugo replied confidently. Crow laughed.
    </p>

    <p><b>Crow: Big talk, kid! Let's see if you have the skills to back it up!</b></p>

    <p>Yugo smirked as he and Crow mounted their D-Wheels. As they looked over their controls one final time, Yugo thought back to the said "changes" to his Deck...</p>

        After taking a shower and putting on their now dry clothes, Yugo and Rin began with the former's preparations for the upcoming Duel with Crow. After looking over his 
        D-Wheel, Yugo felt nothing could go wrong. That is, until Yusei gave a very unexpected suggestion.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Your D-Wheel may be in good condition, but you will need to make some adjustments to your Deck.</b>
    </p>

    <p><b>Yugo: What do you mean "adjustments"? My Deck is fine the way it is.</b><br>Yugo argued.</p>

    <p><b>Yusei: Maybe for Riding Duels in your world, but not here.</b><br>Yusei said, confusing the teens.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Wait, are you saying Riding Duels in your world are different than the ones in ours?</b><br>
        Rin asked. Yusei nodded.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Yes Rin, they are. In this world, when a Riding Duel takes place, a Field Spell called </b>
        <br>“<a class="imag card spell" ><i>Speed World</i><span><img class="resize_card" alt="toto" src="img/SpeedWorld-OW-eng.png"/></span></a> ”
        <b> activates. Recently, it has been upgraded to </b>
        “<a class="imag card spell" ><i>Speed World 2</i><span><img class="resize_card" alt="toto" src="img/SpeedWorld2-OW-eng.png"/></span></a> ”
        <b>
            . In both cases, at the start of each turn, aside from the first turn of the Duel, both Duelists gain a Speed Counter. The maximum amount of Speed Counters any 
            Duelist can have is twelve. Previously, you lose Speed Counters depending on the damage you take. With the upgrade to 
        </b>
        “<a class="imag card spell" ><i>Speed World 2</i><span><img class="resize_card" alt="toto" src="img/SpeedWorld2-OW-eng.png"/></span></a> ”
        <b>
            , that is no longer an issue. These Speed Counters are used to activate a unique type of Magic card exclusively for Riding Duels, called Speed Spells. You can only 
            use certain Speed Spells depending on the number of Speed Counters you have. 
        </b>
        <br>“<a class="imag card spell" ><i>Speed World 2</i><span><img class="resize_card" alt="toto" src="img/SpeedWorld2-OW-eng.png"/></span></a> ”
        <b> has its own Effects, which also need the right number of Speed Counters to use.</b><br>
        Yusei explained. Both Yugo and Rin stared wide eyed from the new details.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Wow. That does make Riding Duels here much more challenging.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Sure does. But I can still use my regular Magic cards, can't I?</b><br>
        Yugo asked, still feeling his Deck didn't need any changes. Yusei once again proved how wrong he was.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Technically you could, but I would not advise it. </b>
        “<a class="imag card spell" ><i>Speed World 2</i><span><img class="resize_card" alt="toto" src="img/SpeedWorld2-OW-eng.png"/></span></a> ”
        <b> has a huge drawback. If at any point a Duelist uses a non-Speed Spell, that Duelist would take 2000 Points of Damage.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo and Rin: 2000?!</b><br>
        The pair shouted in shock. They could not believe this part.
    </p>

    <p><b>Rin: You're kidding?!</b><br>Rin yelled in disbelief.</p>

    <p><b>Yugo: That's like... half your Life Points!</b><br>Yugo added, now slightly paled.</p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yusei: Exactly why you need to change your Deck, so that you won't have to deal with that drawback. Riding Duelists make sure they have no regular Magic cards to 
            avoid this issue. Because of the limited use of Speed Spells, Riding Duelists tend to rely more on their Monsters and Traps. You should too.
        </b><br>
        Yusei advised. Yugo hung over and sighed loudly.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yugo: Dammit. Just when I was starting to like this new world...</b><br>He complained.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: I don't quite agree with it either, but we have to adjust if we're going to be staying here for a while. So suck it up.</b><br>
        Rin said, quickly sounding like her old self. With that, Yugo agreed and began the necessary changes to both survive and win in the upcoming Duel...
    </p>

    <p><i>Flashback End</i></p>

    <p>
        Yugo may not like the new Speed Spell rule (actually, he outright hated it), but he wasn't going to let that stop him. He was going to prove to Jack Atlas that he was 
        a Duelist worth his attention. He and Crow then put on their helmets and revved their D-Wheels to ride.

    </p>

    <p>
        Everyone else looked forward to that Duel as well. It would definitely be one worth seeing. Their celebration was cut short when they all heard a loud beeping noise nearby
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Crow: Where's that coming from?</b><br>Crow asked, looking around.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Rua: There!</b><br>
        Rua shouted as he pointed at Yusei's D-Wheel. To Yusei's shock, the screen on his Duel Disk was flashing red.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
        Yusei became concerned as he ran to his D-Wheel and detached his Duel Disk. The others followed him, wanting to know what was happening.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Why's your Duel Disk doing that?</b><br>
        Rin asked. Yusei became more alert.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: I haven't told you this Rin, but you are not </b>
        <a class="imag card"><i>Akaba Leo</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/de2lq9z-0bf14a08-5e45-40b4-a077-96976f57d5c6.png" style="width: 450px;"></span></a>
        <b> 's only target.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: What?</b><br>
        Rin asked in shock, along with Yugo.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: What do you mean she's not the only target? Who else is that scumbag after?!</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yusei: There are 3 more girls that Leo is trying to get his hands on other than Rin. I have friends that were sent to protect those other girls from him. Now one 
            of them is calling for help. That's what this red light means.
        </b><br>
        Yusei explained.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Crow: A distress signal!</b><br>Crow realized.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Precisely. I have to see who needs help.</b><br>
        When Yusei tapped the red screen, he saw a very familiar object... a pyramid.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: </b>
        <a class="imag card"><i>Yugi</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/dbq2nhg-f653a7f3-ecd6-4c73-b972-f2eeb0284663.png" style="height: 550px; margin-left: 50px;"></span></a>

        He simply said.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>Yusei: What could be happening on his end that he needs the rest of us? Whatever it is, it must be serious.</i><br>
        Yusei then turned to the others.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: </b>
        <a class="imag card"><i>Astral</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/df44394-4358f8e5-0910-4421-a233-b0518321c985.png" style="height: 550px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a>
        <b> 's airship will be here to pick me up any minute.</b><br>
        He stated, which shocked everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rua: You're leaving? But you just got back!</b><br>Rua complained.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: I know, but I'm needed. It can't be helped Rua.</b><br>
        Yusei said, sorrow in his voice.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Aki: Shouldn't we come with you?</b><br>
        Aki suggested, but Yusei shook his head.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: I need you guys to stay here with Yugo and Rin. Also, it won't be just me helping Yugi-san. </b>

        <b> and Astral will be there to help too.</b><br>
        Yusei said.
    </p>
    
    <p>Rin then saw Aki looking very disappointed.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Ruka: How long will you be gone this time?</b><br>Ruka asked.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yusei: I don't know. But I will keep in touch.</b><br>Yusei then turned to Yugo.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Yugo, while you were asleep, I linked up my Duel Disk with yours. That way, we can communicate even when we're literally worlds apart.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Woah, really?</b><br>
        Yugo asked, amazed by this.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Yes. The others will have done the same.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Just then, a loud boom can be heard from above. When the gang looked up, they became awestruck by the sight of a gigantic unfamiliar ship high above the racing track.
    </p>

    </button>

    <p>
        <b>Crow: Holy cow! Is that the ship you were talking about?!</b><br>
        A dumbfounded Crow asked. Another voice had answered for him.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <i>???: Yusei, are you there? Please respond.</i><br>
        Yusei answered at once.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yusei: I'm here Astral. What's the situation?</b></p>

    <p><i>Astral: We don't know yet. Yuma and I have just received Yugi's distress signal. Did you get it?</i><br>Astral asked.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Just now.</b><br>
        Yusei replied.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Have you picked up Judai-san yet?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>That will be our next stop before we rendezvous with Yugi. Are you ready to depart?</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Aki: Wait!</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Someone yelled before Yusei could answer. Everyone looked to see it was Aki. She approached Yusei with a worried expression.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Aki: Are you sure that... you'll be alright?</b><br>
        Yusei nodded as he smiled.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: I will be okay, Aki. Hopefully I will be back soon.</b><br>
        He said.
    </p>

        </center>
    </p>

    <p>
        To everyone's surprise, Aki gave Yusei a quick peck on the cheek. This actually made the young man speechless as he touched the spot Aki kissed him. He was sure to get 
        teased about this later.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Aki: Get back safe, Yusei.</b><br>
        She said before backing away.
    </p>

    <p>
        Rin smiled, knowing she was right about Aki having feelings for the guy. Yusei regained his composure a moment later.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Crow: Go kick ass, Yusei!</b><br>Crow shouted.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rua: We'll all be rooting for you!</b><br>Rua added.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Ruka: Please be careful!</b><br>Ruka said.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Yeah, get back soon buddy!</b><br>Yugo said with his fist out.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Good luck!</b><br>Rin said.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Jack: You better come back, Yusei. We still have a score to settle.</b><br>Jack said.
    </p>

    <p>Yusei laughed, knowing what he meant.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: I will return everyone.</b><br>Yusei said to his friends before he gave Astral his reply.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Astral, I'm ready. Let's get moving!</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>Astral: Of course. Stand by.</i>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Yusei was then covered with a big green light coming down from the ship. As it turned red, Yusei eyed all his friends. Before he left their sight, he caught one more 
        glimpse of Aki with a hopeful expression. She mouthed something to him that made him even more determined to return to his home. With Yusei on board, the ship flew 
        upward and was gone in a flash.
    </p>

    <p>They all looked up, missing their friend already.</p>

    <p><b>Rin: Yusei is a great guy, isn't he Aki?</b><br>Rin asked, turning to the older girl.</p>

    <p>ki nodded while still looking up, smiling.</p>

    <p>

            <b>Aki: Yes, Rin… he is.</b>
