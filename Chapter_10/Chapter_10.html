        warned as he sped to catch up with Yusei and Sergey.
    </p>

    <p><b>Rin: YYugo! What're you doing?!</b></p>

    <p>Rin yelled, holding on to him for dear life. Yugo didn't answer, trying to focus all his attention on saving their new friend.</p>

    <p>
        As hard as he tried, Yusei couldn't break free. He cursed for letting this happen. Sergey continued his insane laughter as they neared the edge.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Sergey: YES! NOW THIS SHALL BE BEAUTIFUL!</b>

    </p>

    <p>
        Just as they were both about to go over, Yugo rammed his D-Wheel into Sergey's to force him away from Yusei. This collision actually caused all three vehicles to fly 
        off the bridge at the same time!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        During the free fall, Sergey did separate from them, still laughing as he fell. Yusei, seeing Yugo and Rin now falling beside him, reached out to them with his right 
        hand. Yugo then reached out with his right. The moment Yusei grabbed Yugo, a few things happened all at once.
    </p>

    <p>
        First <a class="imag card"><i>a red mark shaped like a Dragon's head</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Yusei_Dragon_Head.jpg" style="height: 250px;"></span></a> 
        started glowing on Yusei's right arm. Then <a class="imag card"><i>Yugo's eyes glowed green</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Yugo_berserk.png" style="height: 250px;"></span></a> 
        and began to scream in pain. LRin's bracelet began to glow bright green as well as she continued to hold on to Yugo. And lastly, all three were consumed by a massive 
        <a class="imag card"><i>crimson colored dragon</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Capture2.PNG"></span></a> vthat came out of the sky... And then they were gone. All 
        was quiet once again in the City. Inside the giant creature, on the other hand, things couldn't have been more intense.

    <p>
        Within the beast, Yusei and the two teens appeared to be in a black space with flashing stars passing by. They didn't have time to gaze, for one of them was in great 
        pain. Yugo was still screaming terribly, like he was having the life ripped out of him. He held a hand over his heart as he screamed, while the other was being held 
        firmly by Yusei. Yugo's eyes continued to glow green as this was happening. He was also struggling to break free, but Yusei held him tight.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: ARRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!</b>

        <span id="intSound">

            <audio id="audio2" src="mp3/voice2.mp3"></audio>
            <a onclick="playSound2();"><button><img src="img/Speaker_Icon.svg" alt="hautparleur" style="height: 16px; width: 16px;"></button></a>
            
        </span>
    </p>

    <p>
        As she held on to her friend, Rin noticed that <a class="imag card"><i>the bracelet</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Rin_bracelet.png"></span></a> she was wearing was 
        also giving off a green glow, but in a brighter tone than Yugo's eyes. She also saw the red mark on Yusei's arm. Both of those, however, paled in comparison to her 
        concern with Yugo's condition.
    </p>

    <p><b>Rin: Yugo?! Can you hear me?! Yugo?!</b></p>

    <p>Her friend did not seem to hear her as his screaming persisted. Rin then turned to Yusei.</p>

    <p><b>Rin: Yusei?! Where are we?! What the hell's wrong with Yugo?!</b></p>
    
    <p>
        Although surprised and confused at first, Yusei quickly understood their situation. Seeing both his mark and Rin's bracelet glow after the two of them coming into 
        contact with Yugo somehow told him what needed to be done.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Rin, listen to me! No matter what, don't release Yugo! We both have to keep hold of him until it's over!</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Until <i>what</i> is over?! What are you talking about?!</b><br>
        Rin yelled, starting to sound angry. Yusei remained calm as he tried to reassure her.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: You must trust me! I promise, Yugo will be alright! Just don't let go!</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        He instructed. Although scared as hell and extremely confused, Rin did as he said and kept a firm hold on her friend. At this point, Yugo was now covered by the green 
        light of Rin's bracelet. Before long, Rin and Yusei heard a roar from above and looked up. It was the 
        <a class="imag card"><i>Crimson Dragon</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/CrimsonDragon.jpg" style="width: 550px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a> itself, and it was 
        coming straight for them. Yusei saw that Rin was about to cover Yugo, scared for her friend's life.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yusei: Rin! Don't move! Let it come to Yugo!</b></p>

    <p>Rin looked at him like he had lost his marbles.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Are you insane?! That thing is going to kill him!</b><br>She argued.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Yusei: It won't harm him! Trust me!</b><br>
        He told her again. As much as she didn't like it, she backed off as he instructed. As she did, the Crimson Dragon had reached them and grabbed Yugo with it's front 
        claws. His screaming intensified as the creature began to pull something out of Yugo. Rin's eyes widened with fear and gasped as she saw a dark form being forcibly 
        removed from Yugo's body. Soon that darkness took on the appearance of a 
        <a class="imag card"><i>dragon</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/ArcV_129.png" style="height: 450px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a> with the same dark glowing eyes as Yugo.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: What in the world?!</b><br>
        She said, horrorstruck by the sight before her.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>Yusei: That dark dragon... it must be </i>
        <a class="imag card"><i>Zarc</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/800px-Awaken_Zarc.png" style="height: 450px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a> 
        <i>'s soul fragment inside Yugo!'</i><br>
        Yusei guessed.
    </p>

    <p>
        He and Rin watched the Crimson Dragon firmly grip the dark dragon with all four of it's claws before biting it hard in the neck. Both the dark beast and Yugo screamed 
        excruciatingly from the attack. As the Crimson Dragon continued to bite down, the dark dragon's body started to crack up. A dark red glow shone through the cracks that 
        appeared from the beast's head to it's ferocious tail. All the while, it still struggled to get loose, but it was no good. The Crimson Dragon had no intention of 
        releasing the malevolent creature.
    </p>

    <p>
        Before long, the dark dragon gave off one final defiant roar as it disintegrated in an explosion of dark red light. As this happened, Yugo stopped screaming and his 
        eyes became normal again before he fell unconscious on Rin's lap.
    </p>

    <p><b>Rin: Yugo!</b></p>

    <p>
        Rin yelled as she held him tight. Yusei was glad and pleasantly surprised that this had occurred. With it's task done, the Crimson Dragon roared in triumph and touched 
        the tip of it's tail to Rin's bracelet before she could do anything. It glowed even brighter, completely obscuring everything in the area, including Yusei, Rin, and 
        Yugo...

        <i> to travel between worlds? How did we...?</i>
    </p>

    <p>
        He looked down at the mark on his right arm, which had finally stopped glowing. He then remembered the Crimson Dragon touching Rin's bracelet before arriving here.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Could it be?</b><br>
        He asked himself softly as he heard Rin speaking again.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Yusei? What happened? Where are we? And is Yugo okay?</b>
    </p>

    <p>The girl asked frantically. Yusei then went over and checked their friend. He was pleased that he still had a heartbeat and a pulse.</p>

    <p><b>Yusei: Yugo is fine. He just needs to sleep now.</b></p>

    <p>Rin smiled as she looked down at Yugo. But she still had questions, and she didn't take long to demand them.</p>
    
    <p>
        <b>
            Rin: I'm glad Yugo is alright, but I'm still confused as hell! Where are we?! How did we get here?! Why did my bracelet glow?! What's the deal with that mark on

        </b>
    </p>

    <p>Rin asked rapidly in anger and worry. She stopped to catch her breath. Yusei understood her frustration and need for answers.</p>

    <p>Yusei and Rin turned to see a young man with spiked up orange hair wearing wearing a sleeveless vest and other biker clothes. He was running up to them, looking concerned.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Its okay. Crow Hogan is one of my oldest friends. We grew up together.</b><br>
        Yusei explained as Crow reached them.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Crow: Hey, about time you got back, buddy! I was wondering if you somehow preferred "that" world over ours!</b><br>
        Yusei grinned.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Never.</b><br>
        He said as the two of them laughed.
    </p>

    <p>Rin had no idea what Crow meant when he said "that world". Crow then finally noticed the two new arrivals.</p>

    <p><b>Crow: Let me guess, Yugo and Rin?</b><br>Crow asked. The girl nodded.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: I'm Rin, and this is Yugo. He's not hurt or anything. Just out cold.</b><br>
        Rin said, explaining why Yugo wasn't awake.
    </p>

    <p><b>Rin: It's kind of a long story.</b><br>Crow nodded.</p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Crow: Glad to know you're both okay. Yusei told me about you two before he left. Name's Crow. I guess I'm the first to say "Welcome to our world!"

    </p>
    
    <p>
        He said with a chuckle. Rin couldn't help but join in, even though she had no idea what he was talking about. Still, he seemed like a good person, plus Yusei did say they were friends.
    </p>

    <p><b>Crow: Can I give you guys a hand?</b></p>

    <p><b>Rin: Yes, please.</b></p>

    <p>
        Rin said appreciatively. Crow picked up Yugo and carried him inside the apartment, while Yusei and Rin brought their respective D-Wheels into the garage. Crow took 
        Yugo to a vacant room and laid him on the bed. Rin liked the look of the place as she gazed around.

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Blackbird? You named it?</b><br>
        Rin asked. She was surprised to see Crow suddenly look somber.

    <p>
        <b>Crow: Actually, I didn't. It originally belonged to an old friend of mine named, </b>

        He stopped talking as he lowered his head and closed his eyes. Rin covered her mouth.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: I'm sorry. I didn't know.</b><br>
        Rin apologized. Crow then shook his head.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Crow: Ah, don't worry about it. It's ancient history. He left it to me... among a few other things.</b><br>
        Crow said vaguely.
    </p>

    <p><b>Crow: Anyways, Yusei...</b><br>Crow said, getting Yusei's attention.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Crow: Didn't you say that a giant ship was supposed to drop you guys off here? Cause I didn't see a ship, just the Akakiryū soaring out of the sky.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Ship? Akakiryū?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Rin asked, not knowing what Crow was talking about. She then recalled one of the dragons that she saw on their way to Yusei's home. The one that was crimson colored 
        and destroyed the dark one that came out of Yugo...
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Yusei: There was an unexpected change in plans.</b><br>
        Yusei said. Before he could explain more, the front door to their apartment had burst open.

        Three more people came in to join the group. One was a tall young woman about the same age as Yusei with dark burgundy hair in a almost gothic outfit. The other two 
        were twin children with green hair. The first one, a boy, had his hair in a small ponytail. The other twin was a girl with her hair in two pigtails. All three seemed 
        glad that Yusei had retuned.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: More friends?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Crow: Oh yeah.</b><br>
        Yusei was then hugged by the small twins first, and then by the older woman.

        <b>Rua: We knew you came back! We all felt it! Through our birthmarks!</b>

        Rua, the twin boy, said excitedly as he pointed at a

        Rin wondered what all those marks meant and how they let them know Yusei had returned.

        <b>Ruka: We came here as soon as we realized it!</b><br>

    <p>
        <b>Aki: We missed you too, Yusei. We all did...</b>
    </p>

    <p>The older woman, Aki, said softly. Rin noticed a certain twinkle in her eye the moment she saw him and smiled a bit. She then noticed her at last.</p>

    <p><b>Aki: Who's that?</b></p>

    <p>The twins saw Rin as well, with the boy blushing and seeing hearts upon seeing her.</p>

        Rin said politely as she bowed.

    <p><b>Rin: Nice to meet you all.</b></p>

    <p><b>Ruka: Hi Rin.</b></p>

    <p><b>Rua: H-Hi.</b></p>

    <p>Rua stammered a bit and appeared awkward. Rin thought he was a little shy, but didn't seem to mind.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Aki: Welcome Rin.</b><br>
        Aki said. She then looked around but didn't see anyone else other than Crow.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Aki: Wait, wasn't there a boy that was supposed to be with her?</b><br>
        She asked Yusei.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Yugo? He's here too, but he's sleeping in Jack's room right now. He's been through a lot tonight and we should let him rest.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Ruka: What do you mean? What happened to him?</b><br>Ruka asked, sounding concerned.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Rin: I still like to know that myself.</b>
    </p>

    <p>Rin said, now sounding impatient as she placed her hands on her hips. Yusei then turned to her.</p>

        <b>Yusei: Rin, remember me telling Yugo that he and </b>
        <a class="imag card"><i>Yuri</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Yuri.png" style="width: 550px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a>
        <b> shared a deep connection?</b><br>
        He asked, with Rin nodding in response.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yusei: Well, that connection has to do with a powerful evil that slept within both of them.</b></p>

    <p><b>Rin: Evil?! What evil?! You mean that black dragon thing that came out from inside Yugo?!</b><br>Rin said, sounding scared for her childhood friend.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: I'll explain it in more detail later, but yes. It was harming him, but the other creature you saw, the </b><br>
        <a class="imag card"><i>Akakiryu</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/CrimsonDragon.jpg" style="width: 550px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a>
        <b>, extracted that dark dragon from Yugo's soul and disintegrated it. Yugo's life is no longer in danger from it.</b><br>
        Yusei explained, further assuring her that Yugo would be fine.
    </p>

    <p><b>Rin: How did it do that? And how was my bracelet involved?</b><br>Rin asked as she held up her bracelet.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Your bracelet also had a connection to that darkness, but a different kind. It's power helped the Crimson Dragon destroy that evil within Yugo.</b><br>
        Yusei said. He made himself a mental note to bring this up when he and the others get their meeting underway.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Rin: That Akakiryū... just what is it? And what does it have to do with all those marks you have?</b><br>
        Rin inquired, pointing at everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
        With a nod from Yusei, everyone showed Rin their marks.
        <a class="imag card"><i>Crow's mark</i><span><img id="DisImg" src="img/Mark_of_the_Dragon_-_Tail.jpg" alt="GFG image" style="width: 350px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a> 
        looked just like the end of the Crimson Dragon's tail, the part that touched Rin's bracelet. Yusei then told her the story.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yusei: These are the Dragon Birthmarks of the Signers. Every 5000 years, a benevolent entity known as the Crimson Dragon would choose certain individuals to be 
            given it's power, through these marks. These Signers would use their power to save the world from a great darkness that threatened to destroy the world. My friends 
            and I are the most recent Signers to be chosen. Originally, there were five of us from the start...
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rua: Now there's six! And you're looking at the newest one!</b><br>
        Rua said proudly, showing off his mark in a way to impress Rin. This made his twin sister sigh in annoyance. Rin seemed in awe of the tale.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: That sounds amazing. I can't wait to tell Yugo all this when he wakes up. But wait...</b><br>
        She then counted everyone aside from herself.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: If there are six of you, then where is the last one?</b>
    </p>

    <p><b>Crow: He's out of town on a training trip.</b><br>Crow said.</p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Aki: But like us, he had to have felt Yusei's return through his birthmark too. He'll probably be back sometime late tomorrow afternoon at the earliest if he's 
            already on his way.
        </b><br>
        Aki guessed.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Ruka: Maybe by then, Yugo will have woken up. I can't wait to meet him.</b><br>
        Ruka said eagerly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yusei smiled too. He looked forward to seeing Rin and Yugo meet "that" Signer when he showed up.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: I think you all will like him. He's a bit crude and annoying, but he's a good guy over all.</b><br>
        Rin said with a laugh. This got a laugh from several of the others too.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: By the way, who is the Signer that isn't here?</b><br>
        She asked.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rua: Oh, he's...</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Rua started to answer, but stopped when he heard a cough from his sister, who also gave him a look that said "Don't tell her". He then remembered that he wasn't 
        supposed to say anything to the new arrivals about "him" until he returned. Rin didn't seem to notice this subtlety.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rua: He's someone I think you and Yugo will take a liking too.</b><br>
        He said quickly before turning to Yusei.
    </p>

    <p><b>Rua: So Yusei, tell us about that world you went too! What happened there?</b></p>
    
    <p>
        Rua asked, more than eager to hear the tale of how Yusei found Yugo and Rin and how he helped them escape 
        <a class="imag card"><i>Akaba Leo</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/de2lq9z-0bf14a08-5e45-40b4-a077-96976f57d5c6.png" style="width: 450px;"></span></a> 's grasp. 
        Yusei recounted the whole thing, from watching over the Synchro pair to knocking out Yuri, and finally the incident with Sergey at the bridge. Everyone gasped when 
        they heard Yusei say they all fell.

    <p>
        <b>
            Yusei: My original plan was for the three of us to ride out of the City, just far enough that I could contact Astral with my Duel Disk to pick us up and bring us 
            back here. Sergey's interference changed that. As for how we got back, my guess is that when the Crimson Dragon touched Rin's bracelet with it's tail, it gained 
            the ability to travel to my world.
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Aki: Incredible. I knew the Akakiryū could travel across time, but I didn't know it could borrow other powers to use as it's own.

        Aki said in awe.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Travel across time? And why do you keep talking about other worlds?</b><br>
        Rin said, confused.

        <b> a message saying that I've returned here safely with you and Yugo.</b><br>
        Yusei said.
    </p>

    <p>
        As he detached a Duel Disk from his D-Wheel and began typing in his message, Rin asked him one more question she needed an answer for.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Yusei, you still haven't told me why that guy, Leo Akaba, tried to have me kidnapped. What does he want with me?</b><br>
        Rin asked. Crow and the others looked apprehensive. Yusei paused in typing and gave the teen girl a hard look.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yusei: Years ago, he lost his only daughter. He has come up with a plan to resurrect her, and you are a part of it. However, the process of reviving her... 
            would kill you. I couldn't allow that.
        </b><br>
        Yusei answered before resumed making his message. Rin stood horrified by the revelation.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>
            Rin: Kill me?! Seriously?! I thought he was just some sick pervert who had a thing for teenage girls! But this?! Why would he choose me?!
        </i>
    </p>

    <p>
        Rin couldn't understand why she of all people was chosen for Leo Akaba's insane plans. She suspected Yusei knows more than he's told her and Yugo, but she honestly 
        didn't want to learn more right now... not after this. After a moment, Rin calmed herself, knowing she was fine thanks to Yusei. She then tried to stifle a yawn. Crow, 
        however, noticed.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Crow: Alright, it's bedtime for you. From what we've all heard, you and your boyfriend had a hell of a night. You both need some serious shut eye.

        Rin went red in the face.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Rin: Boyfriend?! You mean Yugo?! No way! He's NOT my boyfriend! We're more like brother and sister! We grew up together in an orphanage! There's NOTHING going on 
            between us, okay?!
        </b><br>
        Rin shouted, sounding slightly embarrassed. Crow only snickered.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Crow: Whatever you say. Now let's find you some pjs and a place to sleep.</b><br>
        He said, still smiling at Rin's reaction. Hearing her outburst regarding Yugo made Rua feel more hopeful with his chances with her. That is, until Ruka pulled him away 
        from earshot.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rua: What? What is it, Ruka?</b><br>
        Rua asked, puzzled by being pulled away like that.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Ruka: Rua, listen to me for a second. Don't get any ideas about Rin. She's too old for you. Plus, from what we've just heard, Yugo sounds a lot like you... and she 
            sees him as a brother to look after. You're not boyfriend material for her.
        </b><br>
        Like Rin, her older brother also went red upon and started to overreact.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rua: I... I don't know what you're talking about! I never said a thing about wanting to be her boyfriend!</b><br>
        He whispered frantically, so that Rin couldn't hear him. Ruka crossed her arms, not buying a word of it.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Ruka: Oh come on, it's so obvious. The way you were looking at her and attempting to impress her earlier. You have a serious crush on Rin. We are twins remember, 
            and I know you. You can't hide something like this from me.
        </b><br>
        Ruka retorted. Rua grunted and turned away, still in denial.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rua: You got it all wrong.</b><br>
        He said before walking away to pretend to examine Yugo's D-Wheel, though not without sneaking a glance or two at Rin along the way. Ruka shook her head and sighed.
    </p>

    <p><b>Aki: Rua has his first crush, doesn't he?</b><br>Aki asked as she approached Ruka.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Ruka: Looks that way. He does know that Rin and Yugo's stay is only temporary. He's just going to get hurt in the end.</b><br>
        Ruka said, concerned for her brother's feelings. Aki only smiled.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Aki: He can't help it Ruka. Rin is a cute girl, you know. One day, you'll start crushing on some cute boy.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Ruka: Not a chance.</b><br>
        Ruka said defiantly, making Aki giggle.
    </p>

    <hr size="1" noshade="">

    <p>
        That night, after Aki and the twins left, Rin slept on a sleeping bag in the room Yugo was sleeping in. She insisted she wanted to be there when he woke up the next 
        morning. However, as the new day came, Yugo still slept on. Even the smell of a hot breakfast didn't make the boy stir. Rin sighed; this usually worked when Yugo slept 
        late.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Having that thing ripped out must've taken more out of him than I thought.</b><br>
        Rin said, now starting to worry more about him.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Crow: Don't worry so much. Yugo will wake up when he wakes up. Until then, who wants some eggs and French toast?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Crow called out as he served breakfast. Aki, Rua, and Ruka had joined him, Yusei, and Rin while he was cooking. They were about to eat when someone actually answered 
        Crow's breakfast announcement.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: I sure as hell do!</b><br>
        Called a new voice from near the garage. Rin and the Signers turned to see Yugo, finally awake.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Oh, morning Rin! Glad you're okay!</b><br>
        Yugo said happily.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Rin: Yugo! How're you feeling?</b><br>
        Rin asked as she got out of her chair and hugged him, happy he was up and about again.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: My body still kinda aches and I'm starving. Other than that, I'm right as rain!</b><br>
        He said with a smile. Rin then suddenly frowned.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Good.</b><br>
        She said... right before she punched him in the gut.

            Rin: You idiot! You nearly got us killed by that stunt you pulled on the bridge! That was by far the stupidest thing you have ever done!
        </b><br>
        Rin said angrily. Yugo started to recover as he straightened up.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yugo: Rin, I was... trying to save Yusei!</b></p>

    <p><b>Rin: In doing so, you sent all of us falling nearly to our deaths! We were lucky to have survived that!</b></p>
    
    <p><b>Yugo: I had to do something! What was I supposed to do, let Sergey kill him?!</b><br>Yugo argued.</p>

    <p><b>Rin: Well, of course not! But still...!</b></p>

    <p>
        <b>Rua: Uh, Rin? Don't you think he's had enough? All of you did get out of that mess alive, didn't you?</b><br>
        Rua tried to reason.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Stay out of this Rua! This is between me and Yugo!</b><br>
        Rin snapped at him. Rua quickly turned away and just stared down at his empty plate. He suddenly didn't think Rin looked cute anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: Rin, enough.</b><br>
        Yusei said firmly.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yusei: ugo did what he thought he had to do to save me. It may have been reckless, but it's in the past now. Please let it go and move on.
        </b><br>
        At his words, Rin finally calmed down and looked back at Yugo.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Yugo, I'm sorry I hit you. Yusei's right. Let's just forget about it and eat something.</b><br>
        This immediately cheered him up.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Oh yeah! Chow time!</b><br>
        Yugo said in praise as he and Rin took seats at the table.
    </p>

    <p>
        After introducing him to everyone, Rin filled Yugo in on what he missed and what she herself learned regarding him, Yusei and his friends. She did not, however, share 
        the details of why Leo Akaba was after her. When Yugo noticed this and asked, she simply told him she wasn't feeling up to telling him yet. Seeing how Rin really 
        didn't want to discuss it, he let that subject drop for the time being. Although initially scared that he had a evil dragon living inside him, he was very relieved to 
        learn Yusei got rid of it with the help of Rin and the Crimson Dragon. He was awed from every detail.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Holy crap! All that sounds beyond awesome!</b><br>
        He then turned to Yusei.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Thanks for saving our butts last night, Yusei!</b><br>
        Yusei shook his head.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yusei: It was really the Akakiryū that saved us from that fall, and you from the darkness that was attacking you.</b><br>
        He said modestly.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Hey man, don't sell yourself short! You still helped to save us, even if that Akakiryū did do most of the work!</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Aki: Don't mind Yusei. He's very modest.</b><br>Aki replied.
    </p>

    <p>
        As the Synchro pair got to know everyone, one person at the table hardly said a word. Yugo noticed this when he saw Rua slowly eating his toast.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Hey Rua? You don't look so good. What's up?</b><br>
        Rua didn't look up.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Rua: Nothing.</b><br>
        He said quietly. Ruka knew what it must be.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Ruka: I don't think he liked being yelled at by his crush.</b>
    </p>

    <p>She said bluntly, which kinda surprised Yugo and Rin. Rua turned to his sister, panic stricken.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Rua: Ruka! Leave me alone! I said nothing of the sort!</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        He shouted, red faced and sweated from embarrassment. He instantly got out of his seat and moved to Yusei's D-Wheel, leaning against it with his back to everyone. 
        All the while, he still avoided eye contact from said crush. To Rua's surprise, Yugo laughed.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Oh don't dwell on it. Rin yells at me lots of times! She just worries too much! You'd get used to it.</b>
    </p>

    <p>This didn't really help the boy, still looking away. Seeing this, Rin got up and walked to him.</p>

    <p><b>Rin: Rua?</b><br>She said tentatively as she stood next to him, getting his attention. He still didn't look at her. She sighed before continuing.</p>
    
    <p>
        <b>
            Rin: I'm sorry. I shouldn't have snapped at you. I was really mad at Yugo and I took out some of my anger on you. That was wrong and you didn't deserve it. Can you 
            please look me in the eye and forgive me?
        </b><br>
        She asked kindly. Reluctantly, Rua slowly turned back around and faced Rin. He looked uncertain.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rua: You really mean it?</b><br>
        He asked, still sounding a little hurt. Rin smiled as she hugged him.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Of course I do. And also, I'm flattered that you have a crush on me.</b><br>
        She said softly. Rua blushed before looking away again.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rua: Ruka said that, not me. But yeah... I forgive you.</b><br>
        He muttered, making Rin laugh.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Thank you. Also, just because you didn't say it doesn't mean it's not true.</b><br>
        She whispered before heading back to the table.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: So, everything cool between you two?</b><br>
        Yugo asked.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: Yeah, we're cool.</b><br>
        Rin replied as Rua also returned, now noticeably more cheerful.

        After breakfast, Yusei decided to give Yugo and Rin a tour of Neo Domino City, with the twins accompanying them. Aki left cause she had plans with her parents, while 
        Crow stayed behind to look after the place.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        On their D-Wheels, Yusei led the group in front, with Yugo and Rin riding on his left and the twins on the right. The Synchro pair were surprised to see the D-Boards 
        the kids were riding.

        Rin commented.

    <p>
        <b>Rua: Yusei made mine, and Ruka got hers from... someone else.</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Rua said, not comfortable with mentioning who gave Ruka her board. Rin didn't press the issue as she was more interested in the similarities and differences between 
        the world she and Yugo came from, and the world they are in now.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: So, at breakfast you said Yugo and I left our world and traveled to your world? A world totally different from ours?</b><br>
        Rin asked curiously.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yusei: We did. Our worlds are nowhere near each other. A barrier keeps them separated. The ship we were supposed to use could bypass that barrier without causing

        Yusei explained.

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Really? Were our worlds the same somehow?</b><br>
        Yugo asked. Yusei thought back to how everything began in his life.

        </b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Yugo and Rin were sad that their new friend had grown up in such an environment and was treated as horribly as they were.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: My gosh, Yusei. That actually sounds worse than how we lived.</b><br>
        Rin said sympathetically.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Damn man. But obviously, you don't live that way anymore. What changed everything?</b><br>
        Yugo asked.
    </p>

    <p>Yusei then pointed at a massive bridge stretching across the water.</p>

            there's hardly any discrimination left at all. We all became one in mind and heart.

        Yusei said, grateful for the positive changes for the place he called home.

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: That's one awesome story.</b><br>
        Yugo said, truly touched by the tale. Rin actually had a tear in her eye.

        Yusei said with encouragement.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yugo and Rin also hoped they could make their world a better place like Yusei's world. They then discussed where the duo would stay while they were here.

        Soon after, they have arrived at Rua and Ruka's penthouse atop a building looking over the city. Yugo and Rin were impressed with their living quarters, and were 
        simply amazed when they stepped out onto a large open area with a big pool. The view was spectacular.
    </p>

            Yugo: Wow! You kids get to live all the way up here?! And you have a pool?! I'm so freaking jealous! In our world, only someone living in the Tops can get a place like this!

    <p>
        <b>Rua: Yeah, but it's no big deal. We still hang out with our friends when we're not in school.</b><br>

        <b>Yusei: Sounds like you could use some more company.</b><br>
        Yusei said while looking at Yugo and Rin.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rua: Yeah! Would you guys like to stay here until it's safe for you to go back home?</b><br>
        Rua begged.
    </p>

    <p>

        Ruka insisted.

        Yugo asked.
    </p>

    <p>
        Rin still looked unsure. She turned to Yusei, who also agreed with the idea. She didn't want to intrude in their new friends' home. Although, she did admit to herself 
        it would be nice to stay in a place that let you look at the city from up high instead of from down below. Before she could answer...

        Rua challenged Rin. Rin smiled and nodded. This just might be what she needed.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: I like that idea. The thing is... I don't have a Duel Disk.</b><br>

        <b>Yugo: It was an accident! I didn't mean for us to fall in like that! I'm sorry! I...</b><br>
        Any further apologizing never came as Rin forced Yugo's head underwater for several seconds. When he came up, the boy wanted payback.

    <p>
        <b>Yugo: Alright Rin, you've asked for it!</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        He then gave her a huge splash in the face, which Rin immediately retaliated with. Soon they laughed as their splash war raged on. Yusei and Ruka smiled to see the two 
        enjoying themselves, while Rua saw how happy Rin was having fun with Yugo. He thought maybe they really were meant for each other, even if they don't know it yet...
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>???: So Yusei, <i>these</i> are the two you told me about before?</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Yugo and Rin stopped when they heard a new voice speaking to Yusei. As they looked to see who had arrived, the pair immediately wished they weren't caught in the 
        middle of splashing each other like little children. Both of them looked so mortified that it was laughable.

        <b>Yugo: Holy crap! Rin, is... is that... ?!</b><br>
        Yugo sputtered. He couldn't believe who was now standing with Yusei, Rua, and Ruka.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Rin: I... I don't... believe it!</b><br>
        Rin squeaked in complete disbelief.
    </p>

    <p>
        There, looking down at Yugo and Rin from the edge of the pool, arms crossed with a look that said he wasn't impressed with the display, was the very person they wanted 
        to one day face in their world... and the one person they wished had not caught them in their position.
