        After everyone had left, <a class="imag card"><i>Yuya</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/FullYuyaSakaki.png" style="width: 450px; margin-left: 125px;" ></span></a> went 
        up to his room, fell back on his bed, and sulked. No matter what he said about him being fine, his <a class="imag card"><i>mom</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/FullYokoSakaki.png" style="height: 550px; margin-left: 125px;"></span></a> 
        wouldn't hear of it. He still couldn't believe he wasn't allowed to duel for a whole week! He'd been dueling for years, and he didn't have any issues up till now. He 
        had been raised to be both healthy and athletic, both of which are necessities for Action Duels.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yuya: This sucks! My chest hasn't hurt since yesterday. I don't feel any pain at all!</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Yuya complained to himself. Still, even though he felt fine, he couldn't help wondering what caused his pain to begin with. And he didn't understand why it hurt so 
        much. Even his doctor could not find the cause, making everyone worry over Yuya even more. While Yuya himself was worried if it happened again, he felt sure that 
        whatever had hurt him like that had nothing to do with his current health.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sighing, he decided that lying on his bed all day wouldn't do him any good. He needed to go out and get some fresh air. Maybe a simple walk in the park? Surely that 
        wouldn't be a problem. He was just about to go and ask his mom for permission, but to his surprise she came knocking on his door.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yoko: Yuya? May I come in?</b><br>Yoko asked through the door.</p>

    <p><b>Yuya: Sure.</b><br>Yuya said as he sat up on his bed. After coming inside, Yoko sat down next to her depressed son.</p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yoko: Look, I'm sorry if I'm being unfair Yuya. Its just we're all worried about you, especially me. I don't want whatever it was that happened to you happen 
            again. You are one of the healthiest boys I know, but sometimes things like this happen that even an experienced physician can't explain.
        </b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Yuya: I know Mom. But not being able to duel doesn't mean I'm cooped up here for the whole weekend, right?</b><br>
        Yuya asked, hoping his mom would be open to his request.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yoko: Of course not.</b><br>Yoko answered while shaking her head.</p>

    <p><b>Yoko: You can do other activities that don't involve raising your heart rate in here. Did you have something in mind?</b></p>

    <p>Yuya fidgeted for a bit before asking.</p>

    <p><b>Yuya: Maybe just a... walk in the park?</b><br>He tentatively asked.</p>

    <p><b>Yuya: I know what you're thinking, but I will only be walking, no running! I promise to walk slowly the whole time! Please!</b></p>

    <p>
        Yuya begged. Yoko did appear about to protest, but she saw how miserable her son looked. She could tell Yuya really wanted to get out of the house. Yoko sighed, 
        feeling she might regret her choice.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yoko: Fine, Yuya. A slow walk in the park it is.</b><br>Yuya then hugged his mom in gratitude.</p>
    
    <p><b>Yuya: Thanks Mom!</b></p>

    <p>
        Yuya said, feeling happier already, making Yoko smile herself. She then looked over at a picture on Yuya's beside table with her, Yuya, and his father. She really missed 
        <br><a class="imag card"><i>Yusho</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Yusho.jpg" style="width: 550px; margin-left: 125px;"></span></a>, and knew he would also be 
        concerned about Yuya's unknown condition. However, he would also see to it that Yuya remained happy no matter how bad things got. Knowing that, she gave Yuya a bottled 
        water and some dried fruit and nuts as a snack while he was gone.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yoko: Remember Yuya, slow walking only. Do NOTHING that would get you too excited!</b><br>Yoko warned. Yuya nodded.</p>

    <p><b>Yuya: Got it. Thanks again Mom! I'll be back soon!</b></p>

    <p>
        With that, Yuya left for the park, which actually wasn't far from where he lived. He was allowed to bring his Duel Disk, with a promise that he wouldn't use it for 
        dueling; only phone calls and video messages. Yoko smiled after him before she closed the door behind her as she walked back in.

    <p>
        After reaching the park not long after, Yuya took a path that ran along the edges. As Yuya walked, he breathed in the fresh scents from the pink colored flowers in the area. He didn't know why, but those flowers reminded him of when 
        <a class="imag card"><i>Yuzu</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/FullZuzuBoyle.png" style="height: 550px; margin-left: 125px;"></span></a> was around. He always seemed 
        to associate Yuzu with flowers. He smiled at the thought as he strolled on.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>
            Yuya: I always smile when Yuzu was there. She's been there a lot for me, especially during the years since Dad vanished. I can't imagine my life if she weren't 
            around. I just wish Yuzu wouldn't swat me with that fan of hers when I say something that upsets her. Still, she's one of the best things in my life. Maybe, the 
            best...
        </i><br>
    </p>

    <p>He then started to shake his head.</p>
    
    <p>
        <i>
            Yuya: Ah, what I am I thinking? Yuzu's one of my best childhood friends. And now for some reason, I'm thinking of her as more than that. What's up with me?
        </i><br>
        Yuya said to himself, sounding annoyed and confused.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yuya: Get a grip, Yuya. Yuzu is just a friend.</b></p>

    <p>
        He then thought of the time during the day Sora was stalking him and had mistaken Yuzu for Yuya's girlfriend. Yuya's remark of how he could never date a rough girl like her earned him a good smack from Yuzu's fan.
    </p>

    <div id="DisImg1">

        <video controls width="550">

    </div>

    <button type="button" onclick="show1()" id="btnID1">
        Click Me
    </button>

    <p>At the time, he really hadn't thought of dating anyone, let alone Yuzu. He just didn't see her that way.</p>

    <p><i>Yuya: Could it be that something about me... has changed? Something that makes me... think of her differently?</i></p>

    <p>Yuya had no idea where these new thoughts are coming from.</p>

    <p>
        Come to think of it though, he recalled a very recent memory with Yuzu. When he woke up in the hospital after his painful outburst, aside from his mother, Yuzu was 
        the first person he saw standing over him. He saw how happy and relieved she was that he was awake again. She also cried a little, lightly berating Yuya for making her 
        worry like that. When he first saw her then, he felt something he hadn't before.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yuya had put a hand over where his heart was. Not because he was in pain again, but because that "something" had started to nag at him and he couldn't figure out what 
        it was. Whatever it was, it was making Yuya's heart beat a little faster when he started thinking of Yuzu. He then began bonking his head with his fist.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <b>Yuya: Knock it off! I'm not supposed to get my heart racing out here! I promised Mom that!</b>
    </p>

    <p>Yuya complained to himself. He wished there was something that could keep his mind off his new personal dilemma.</p>

    <p>Oddly enough, his wish got granted when he spotted someone jumping down from a tree near a performing platform.</p>

    <div id="Dis2">


        <img src="img/central.jpg" alt="house" style="width: 50%;">

    </center>

    <p>
        He then sat there and looked around like he was expecting someone to meet up with him. Curious, Yuya hid behind the closest tree to see. The stranger didn't seem to notice him.
    </p>

    <p>
        As he sat waiting on the platform, <a class="imag card"><i>Dennis</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/FullDennisMacfield.png" style="height: 750px;"></span></a> 
        felt confident that Yuzu Hiragi wouldn't escape like the other bracelet girls had. With </b><a class="imag card"><i>Edo Phoenix</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/FullAsterPhoenix(ArcV).png" style="height: 750px; margin-left: 100px"></span></a> 
        and the <br><a class="imag card"><i>Obelisk Force</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Obelisk_Force.png" style="width: 550px; margin-left: 125px;"></span></a> 
        at his command, he knew it would be a matter of time before 
        <a class="imag card"><i>Sora</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/dbr87pp-157ec38a-07f1-4b9d-98ad-6849eb7127a7.png" style="height: 450px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a> 
        was defeated and carded.
    </p>

    <p>
        He felt sorry for the little guy. Sora was a promising young Duel Soldier who, for some reason, got a little too attached to the girl the Professor needed captured.

    </p>

    <p><i>Dennis: Poor Sora. He must've developed a real soft spot for that Yuzu girl. And he hasn't even been here for that long.</i><br>He sighed in pity.</p>

    <p>
        Dennis could understand that. He actually developed a likeness to the Xyz bracelet girl, 
        <a class="imag card"><i>Ruri Kurosaki</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Lulu_Obsidian.png" style="height: 350px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a>. She was kind, 
        caring, and loved to make others smile. Kind of like him. Maybe if he had a little more time, he might've actually done what Sora was trying to do. Of course, Dennis
        wasn't that young and naïve. As much as he loved to entertain, and really did enjoy entertaining Ruri in their Duel, he couldn't abandon his mission for Academia... 
        or the Professor.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <i>
            Dennis: he Professor made it clear that capturing those girls was a top priority. But, what priority? Why are those girls so special to him? The only things they seem to have in common are that they have the same face as 
        </i>
        <a class="imag card"><i>Serena</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/dc07e3ada036cdd73485db4c0cc070ae.jpg" style="height: 450px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a>
        <i>
            and they each have a bracelet like hers. I sorta wish I knew what...
        </i>
    </p>

    <p>Dennis' thoughts were interrupted when a figure instantly appeared beside him from a vortex of swirling energy. Dennis looked up and smiled.</p>

    <p><b>Dennis: Hey </b><a class="imag card"><i>Yuri</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Yuri.png" style="width: 550px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a><b>.</b></p>

    <p><b>Yuri: Hey yourself.</b></p>

    <p>
        Yuri said as he plopped down and sat next to Dennis. As they greeted one another, they had no idea they were being observed by someone sharing Yuri's likeness.
    </p>

    <p>
        The moment he saw Yuri, Yuya's eyes nearly bulged out of his skull and his jaw nearly fell to the ground. He couldn't believe what he was seeing. He was surprised 
        enough when the second stranger came out of nowhere the way he did. The fact that this new person had the exact same face as he did, however, nearly caused him to 
        faint from shock.
    </p>

    <p><i>Yuya: That guy! He looks... just like me! I must be seeing things!</i></p>

    <p>
        Yuya quickly, but quietly, pinched himself hard to make sure he wasn't hallucinating. When he looked again, nothing had changed. The purple haired teen still strongly resembled him.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <i>Yuya: But why? Why is there someone that looks like me?! Who the heck is he?!</i>
    </p>

    <p>As dumbfounded as he was, Yuya still tried to listen in on what the two were talking about.</p>

    <p><b>Yuri: So, this is where I'm supposed to wait, huh?</b><br>Yuri asked while looking around.</p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Dennis: According to Sora's memories, this is the ideal spot and time where no one would be around. Also, thankfully it isn't far from where the action is 
            happening. Hopefully you won't have to wait long. Edo will give you the signal soon.
        </b><br>Dennis told him.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yuya: What? They know Sora? How?</b></p>

    <p>
        Yuya quietly asked himself. He thought they must've come from wherever Sora learned his Fusion Summoning. After all, the kid didn't give him any details. He also 
        wondered who this Edo person was.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yuri: Is that so Dennis? Well, I'll get bored really quick if no one's here for me to play with.</b><br>
        Yuri said, sounding bored. Dennis chuckled.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Dennis: I hear ya. I'd ask if we could duel to pass the time, but I know how that will turn out. I don't stand a chance against you, Yuri.
        </b><br>
        Yuri gave his own chuckle.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Yuri: Hehe, oh no doubt.</b><br>He then went quiet and looked down, frowning. Dennis noticed this.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Dennis: Hey, what's up? You really are disappointed that I don't want us to duel, aren't you?</b><br>
        Dennis asked, playfully teasing his comrade. To his surprise, Yuri shook his head.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yuri: That's not it. Things just haven't gone well for me lately. First, those two guys that caught me off guard when I tried to capture those girls, Ruri and 
        </b>
        <br><a class="imag card"><i>Rin</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/d40bca3eac748c1d8a9cf82f57ec6984.jpg" style="height: 550px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a>
        <b>. I never even saw the bastard who got me from behind. But both those incidents were nothing compared to when I confronted the guy that helped Serena escape... </b>
        <a class="imag card"><i>Yuki Judai</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/ddg84ua-02d600ad-dc7f-4cdf-b510-c1916324803a.png" style="width: 450px; margin-left: 125px;" ></span></a>
        <b>.</b><br>Yuri said in a low and fearful voice.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yuya had no idea who the people were that Yuri was talking about. What did get his attention was that he tried to kidnap two girls and apparently failed to do so. And 
        another one, Serena, also somehow got away. He could tell that Yuri was not a good person, even if he did look like him. When he mentioned that guy, Judai Yuki, Yuri's 
        tone had changed. He sounded like he was afraid of the guy. Yuri's next statement confirmed it.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yuri: When he confronted me in that hideout, I felt an overwhelming fear that I had never experienced in my life. I <i>never</i> feared anyone until now. And the way he 
            tossed me away like I was a rag doll...
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>He then looked at Dennis square in the eye.</p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yuri: I'm telling you, that Judai wasn't a normal person. Maybe the guys he's working with aren't normal either. Regardless, whoever they are...
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>Yuri then sounded more angry.</p>
    
    <p><b>Yuri: They'll all pay for humiliating me!</b><br>He nearly yelled while tightening his fists.</p>

    <p>
        Yuya could tell Yuri was not someone to piss off. From the sound of it, three people had already done so... and Yuri wanted revenge on them. Dennis patted Yuri's shoulder.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Dennis: Hey, I'm sure you'll get your chance to redeem yourself. Don't forget, we're not completely beaten yet. We still have one girl that hasn't alluded us. With 
            the Professor's new plan in play, I'm sure nothing can go wrong.
        </b><br>
        After taking a moment to calm himself, Yuri smiled again.
    </p>

    <p>
        It wasn't a friendly smile, Yuya saw. He also became concerned that another girl was about to be kidnapped. Whoever this Professor was, Yuya believed he must be 
        dangerous. He felt he had to do something. He should head home and tell his mom what he had just seen and heard. Still, he stayed where he was and continued listening. 
        Maybe he could hear the name of the girl in question. In the next moment, Yuya wished he hadn't heard what Yuri said then.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yuri: I hope you're right Dennis. Edo better do his job and take down the traitor, whether it would be by the Obelisk Force or his own hand. Either way, I will 
            definitely be taking Yuzu Hiragi to the Professor and hopefully get back on his good side.
        </b><br>
        He stated with an evil chuckle.

    <p><i>Yuya: Yuzu!? He's going to kidnap... Yuzu !?</i></p>

    <p>
        Yuya at once felt more shocked, frightened and enraged at the same time. He had no idea which he felt more. He tightened his own fists, bared his teeth, and his whole body started shaking.
    </p>

    <p><i>Yuya: NO! I WON'T LET HIM!</i></p>
    
    <p>Throwing all caution to the wind, Yuya finally decided to confront the monster that shared his face.</p>

    <p>Dennis was glad Yuri seemed to be in a more cheerful mood.</p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Dennis: That sounds like the Yuri I know! Happily anticipating on capturing his next prey.
        </b><br>
        Yuri smirked at him.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yuri: You bet. Maybe this time we won't have any surprises...</b></p>

    <p><b>Yuya: YOU'RE NOT TAKING YUZU ANYWHERE!</b></p>

    <p>
        Yuri and Dennis shot to their feet in surprise when they heard an angry voice shouting at them. They then saw the owner of that voice coming out from behind a nearby 
        tree. To their greater surprise, it was a boy who looked strongly like Yuri. And they could tell that the new guy was pissed as hell.
    </p>

    <p><b>Dennis: You were saying about no more surprises?</b></p>

    <p>Dennis asked as he glanced at a stunned Yuri.</p>

    <p><b>Yuri: Shut up.</b><br>Yuri said quietly. Yuya approached them, not caring about what happened to him.</p>
    
    <p>
        <b>
            Yuya: I heard everything you two had said, including the part where you plan to kidnap Yuzu! I'm not going to let that happen! I won't let you lay one finger on her! Duel me, Yuri!

    </p>

    <p>
        Yuya angrily challenged, slipping on his Duel Disk and activating it. He knew he was breaking his promises to his mother, but under the circumstances he felt he had no 
        choice. Yuri actually seemed amused, with Dennis looking curious.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Dennis: So, you're actually going to duel your lookalike?</b><br>
        Dennis asked. Yuri jumped down and put on his own Duel Disk, now standing before Yuya.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yuri: I don't see why not. At the very least, I won't be sitting around and twiddling my thumbs waiting for Edo to contact me.
        </b><br>
        He said while activating his Duel Disk. Dennis nodded in agreement.
    </p>

    <p><b>Dennis: Welp, you have fun Yuri! I'll see how things are going on Edo's end!</b></p>

    <p>
        With that, Dennis jumped up the trees and was out of sight. Yuya would worry about Dennis later. Right now, his main concern was the guy before him wearing a wicked grin.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yuri: So, you want to duel me to protect Yuzu? I take it she's your girlfriend?</b><br>Yuri taunted. Yuya blushed a bit as he answered.</p>

    <p><b>Yuya: Yuzu's just a friend! But she is very special to me! I'm not letting you take her!</b><br>Rétorqua Yuya. Yuri gloussa de nouveau.</p>
    
    <p><b>Yuri: How gallant of you. What's your name?</b></p>

    <p><b>It's Yuya! Sakaki Yuya!</b><br>Yuya replied strongly. Yuri then smiled like a predator about to stalk it's prey.</p>

    <p><b>Yuri: Well then, Sakaki Yuya, show me if you have the skills to back up your claims!</b></p>

    <p><b>Yuya: Believe me Yuri, I will!</b></p>

    <p>At once, their duel of destiny began.</p>

        Yuya shouted impatiently. He didn't care what Yuri thought of his dragon or even his Pendulum Summoning. All he cared about was stopping that psychopath from getting near Yuzu. Yuri snickered.

        His eyes widened slightly, knowing he could summon "it" now. He was momentarily distracted by a blinking purple light on his Duel Disk. He knew it had to be the signal 
        from Edo. That meant Yuzu Hiragi must be secured at that moment. He should go now to capture her… but he chose not too. He didn't know why, but he felt he needed to 
        duel against Yuya Sakaki. Something deep inside him was telling him, no "begging" him, to face the boy that had his face. It was like an instinct he just couldn't 
        ignore. Edo would have to wait until Yuri's duel was over; he refused put this off for later.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yuya: What are you waiting for? Get on with it!</b><br>Yuri refocused his attention on his opponent.</p>

    <p>At the same time, Yuya and Yuri both felt a sharp pain in their chests. Yuya almost fell to his knees.</p>

    <p><i>Yuya: Not again! Not now!</i><br>He thought in panic, trying not to succumb to the pain.</p>

        Without warning, Yuzu's <a class="imag card"><i>bracelet</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/Yuzu'sBracelet.png"></span></a> had started blinking pink light. This really surprised Yuzu and Sora.

    <p><b>Yuzu: I don't know. It's never done that before. Why is it doing that?</b></p>

    <p>
        She then looked up to ask <a class="imag card"><i>Yugi</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/dbq2nhg-f653a7f3-ecd6-4c73-b972-f2eeb0284663.png" style="height: 550px; margin-left: 50px;"></span></a>

        (whom she couldn't see) looked extremely alarmed.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yuzu: What's wrong Yugi?</b></p>

    <p>Yuzu asked, now sounding scared. He and his friends looked at one another and knew instantly what this meant.</p>

    <p><b>Atem (Yami Yugi): Yuzu, do you know if Yuya is still at his house?</b></p>

    <p>Yugi asked urgently. This question stunned her and Sora.</p>

    <p><b>Yuzu: Yuya? What's Yuya got to do with my bracelet?</b></p>
    
    <p>What he said to her made her panic more than she had ever felt in her life.</p>

    <p><b>Atem (Yami Yugi): I'm afraid that Yuya... is in terrible danger. Call him now!</b></p>
    
    <p>Yugi strongly urged. At once, Yuzu got out her Duel Disk and speed dialed Yuya's number. Instead of ringing, a message popped up on the screen in the center.</p><br>

    <center>
        <p><i>"Unable to reach. Duel in progress."</i></p>
    </center><br>
    
    <p>This really shocked Yuzu.</p>

    <p><b>Yuzu: WHAT?! Yuya is dueling right now?! He's not supposed to be doing that! What is that idiot thinking?!</b></p>

    <p>She yelled in angry disbelief. She then tried to call Yuya's mom next. Thankfully, she picked up.</p>

    <p><b><i>Yoko: Hello?</i></b><br>Yoko asked when she answered.</p>

    <p><b>Yuzu: Mrs. Sakaki, it's Yuzu! Tell me, is Yuya still there?! I need to talk to him now! It's important!</b></p>

    <p>Yuzu requested hurriedly. Yoko, more alert after hearing the tone in Yuzu's voice, acted more serious.</p>
    
    <p>
        <b>
            <i>Yoko: No. I'm sorry, but Yuya went to take a leisurely walk in the park not long after you and the others had left from here. He hasn't come back yet. You couldn't reach him?</i>
        </b><br>
        She asked, now sounding worried.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yuzu: I tried, but my Disk said Yuya was in the middle of a Duel! I never got through!</b><br>
        Yuzu replied. At this, Yoko went livid.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            <i>

                comes back, I'll ground him for a year!
            </i>
        </b><br>
        Yoko practically screamed before hanging up. Yuzu was definitely worried now as she turned back to Yugi and the others.
    </p>

    <p><b>Yuzu: Yuya's not at home! His mother said he went to the park, and apparently is dueling someone there!</b></p>

    <p><b>Yusei: We have to go to the park now! Before it's too late!</b><br>Yusei said as the whole group began to run.</p>

    <p><b>Yuzu and Sora: Too late for what?</b><br>Yuzu and Sora asked as they tried to keep up.</p>

    <p><b>Yuma: If we don't reach Yuya in time, things will turn out very badly for him.</b></p>

    <p>
        Yuma replied grimly. Yuzu and Sora's worry for Yuya grew even more, thinking his life could be in jeopardy yet again. Yugi and the others looked at one another. If 
        Yuya was dueling someone right now, then it could only be one person. And they knew that Yuya battling that person was the reason Yuzu's bracelet was going off.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Judai: One question Yuzu.</b><br>Judai started as they ran.</p>

    <p><b>Yuzu: What's that, Judai-san ?</b><br>Yuzu asked.</p>

    <p><b>Judai: You just said Yuya wasn't allowed to duel anyone. Why is that?</b></p>

    <p>Judai asked. This made the rest of the group just as curious, except for Yugi and Sora. Yuzu grimaced.</p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yuzu: Yesterday, Yuya suffered what looked like a heart attack! One moment he was fine, and the next he grabbed where his heart was and started screaming in agony! 
            That has NEVER happened to him in his life! If Yugi hadn't shown up and healed him, Yuya might have actually died!
        </b>
    </p>

    <p>Judai, Yusei, and Yuma turned to Yugi, alarmed.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Yuma: Yugi, is that true?</b><br>
        Yuma asked. Yugi nodded to confirm.
    </p>

    <p><b>Atem (Yami Yugi): Yes. I was going to bring it up when we had our planned meeting, though I wasn't expecting something like this.</b></p>
    
    <p>Yuzu then continued from there.</p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yuzu: Well, after the incident, Yuya was taken to the hospital! The doctor couldn't actually find anything wrong with his heart, so he let Yuya go home! His mother 
            then forbad him to duel for a week as a precaution! She didn't want Yuya to do anything that would raise his heart rate too much! Why in the world would Yuya do 
            this?!
        </b><br>
        Yuzu said, worried as well as pissed at her friend.
    </p>

    <p>Yugi and his friends knew they had to find Yuya before the unthinkable could happen. They prayed that they would reach the poor boy in time.</p>

    <p><b>Atem (Yami Yugi): Yuya, hang on! We're coming</b><br>Yugi thought, hoping it wouldn't be too late...</p>

    <p>Back in the park, Yuya noticed that Yuri had grabbed his chest also. This really surprised him.</p>

    <p><b>Yuya: You... you're hurting as well?</b><br>Yuya asked painfully. On the other side, Yuri was surprised this was happening to him again.</p>

    <p><b>Yuri: This pain... it's the same... as before...!</b></p>

    <p>
        He then recalled back to when he suffered like this the first time. When he woke up in the Synchro Dimension after being knocked out, Yuri saw that both Rin and his 
        attacker were nowhere to be seen. He was completely alone.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        He figured he must've been out for maybe an hour or so. He punched a wall, annoyed that another girl had gotten away from him, just like in the Xyz Dimension. Yuri 
        would have to search the whole damn City to track down Rin again. And when he found her and the punk that helped her, he would make the latter be sorry he ever messed 
        with him.
    </p>

    <p>
        Yuri was about to head out when an unexpected pain occurred in his chest. He held a hand over where his heart was and started screaming, all the while his 
        <br><a class="imag card"><i>eyes glowed purple</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/800px-YuriDark.png" style="height: 250px; margin-left: 150px;"></span></a>. All his life, 
        he had never suffered anything like this. It was pure torture. The pain was so much he fell on the ground and rolled around, screaming.
    </p>

    <p>
        He didn't know how long this went on, but just as sudden as the pain came, it dissipated. The experience caused him to fall consciousness again. He was then later 
        shaken awake by some <a class="imag card"><i>guy with spiky purple and blue hair</i><span><img alt="toto" src="img/FullShinjiWeber.png" style="margin-left: 150px; height: 650px;"></span></a>.
    </p>

    <p><b>Shinji Weber: Hey, you okay?</b><br>The stranger asked. Yuri pushed him away as he got up.</p>

    <p><b>Yuri: Get away from me!</b></p>

        Yuri said irritably as he got moving to track down Rin and her protector. Of course, he never found them and was forced to return to Academia empty handed once again. 
        After that, the pain never came again until today. He didn't mention this to anyone, not even to the Professor. He refused to show weakness in front of the man or 
        others.
    </p>

    <p>He too noticed that Yuya was suffering the same thing as he did. He almost couldn't believe it.</p>

    <p><b>Yuri: So... you too, huh?</b></p>
    
    <p><b>Yuya: Why are we both hurting?</b></p>

    <p>
        <b>Yuri: Beats me, but it seems like we have... more in common... than just our looks.</b><br>
        Yuri then looked up at the dragons again. They were still roaring at each other, wanting to battle.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yuri: Look at our dragons! They really want to fight one another! They want to tear each other to pieces!</b><br>
        Yuri said, sounding excited at the thought.
    </p>

    <p>
        He hated to admit it, but Yuya was getting the same vibe off of his own dragon. He had no idea what was going on with him, Yuri, or their dragons. All he knew was that 
        he needed to finish this Duel quickly and reach Yuzu.

        <i>Yuya: That explosion felt so real, like I was in an Action Duel... only this isn't an Action Duel. How could he inflict real damage?</i><br>

        Yuya retorted weakly as he looked up at him. His evil lookalike snickered.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yuri: So much concern. You sure she's just your friend?</b><br>

        At these words, Yuya unexpectedly began to have thoughts of Yuzu again. Of all the good times he spent with her, and how she helped him through the bad times. Her warm 
        smile, her encouraging words, her pretty face... Yuya was shocked that he thought that last bit.
    </p>

    <p>
        <i>Yuya: Did I just thought that Yuzu's face was pretty?</i><br>
        As Yuya continued on his train of thought, he began thinking of other things about Yuzu he didn't actually notice before.

    </p>

    <p>
        He then thought again of how he saw her when he woke in the hospital. When he saw her, the overhead light was just behind her head, obscuring everything but her face. 
        It was like looking at the face of an angel... his angel...

        He said softly in total shock. First Edo was forced to retreat, now this. The Professor would definitely go through the roof when he heard about this one.

    </p>

    <p>When he reached the beaten Yuri, his eyes were closed and he too was aching. He was also holding a card in his hand. Yuya knelt down and grabbed his collar.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Yuri: Alright, talk. Why are you after Yuzu? Tell me!</b><br>
        Yuya demanded. Before Yuri could answer, the card glowed a bright purple light. At the same time, a slot in Yuya's Duel Disk also gave off a bright light that enveloped them both.

        <b>Yuri: Because... it's telling me too. Can't your hear it talking? Can't you hear…your own dragon telling you the same thing?</b>
    </p>

    <p>
        Yuya was dumbfounded by Yuri's questions. Although, come to think of it, Yuya did start to hear something from both inside his Duel Disk and from Yuri's card. Not only 
        did he hear two distinct sounds, but to his amazement he also understood them. Yuya understood that 
        <br>“<a class="imag card monsterF" ><i>Starve Venom</i><span><img class="resize_card" alt="toto" src="img/Yuri/eng/StarvingVenomFusionDragon-MADU-EN-VG-artwork.png"/></span></a> ” wanted to be accepted by him, and that

        also urged to accept the dragon it was forced to battle.

    </p>

    <p>
        Even though nothing still made any sense to him, Yuya realized he couldn't ignore the pleas of the two dragons. Finally, Yuya made his choice and took 
        “<a class="imag card monsterF" ><i>Starve Venom Fusion Dragon</i><span><img class="resize_card" alt="toto" src="img/Yuri/eng/StarvingVenomFusionDragon-MADU-EN-VG-artwork.png"/></span></a> ” from Yuri. 
        Looking pleased, Yuri told his lookalike one more thing before his life expired.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>
            Yuri: Hey, Yuya. Do yourself a favor and keep your girlfriend out of harms way. Even if I'm gone, the Professor won't stop going after her... or the others. If you

    <p>At the same time, Yugi's group finally reached the park.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Sora: We're here!</b><br>
        Sora said, nearly out of breath. He still hadn't recovered from his injuries.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Yuma: Let's hope Yuya is alright.</b><br>Yuma said. A moment later, Yuzu's bracelet then gave off a bright pink light.</p>

    <p><b>Yuzu: Now what? Why is my bracelet glowing so bright like this?</b><br>Yuzu said in surprise. Yugi and the others, except Sora, knew what that meant.</p>

    <p>Before either of them could understand this, both the Puzzle and Yuzu's bracelet stopped glowing and became inactive once more.</p>
    
    <p><b>Yuzu: Now my bracelet has stopped! What does it mean?</b></p>

    <p>Yuzu asked Yugi. Before he could say something...</p>

    <p><b>Yusei: There!</b></p>

        Yuzu shouted. Yuya didn't seem to hear her as he fell facedown on the ground. When they reached him, Yuzu and the others were shocked that Yuya was covered in 
        injuries. This really worried the girl.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Yuzu: Yuya? Yuya, wake up! Are you alright? It's me, Yuzu! Wake up Yuya! YUYA!</b>
    </p>

    <p>She yelled as she tried to shake her friend awake, but to no avail. He was completely unresponsive. Yusei then checked his pulse.</p>
    
    <p><b>Yusei: He's alive, just out cold. We need to get him back home.</b></p>

    <p>
        <i>Astral: There is no sign of Yuri anywhere. Perhaps Yuzu got in range of them both before the process could be completed.</i><br>
        Astral said after looking around the area.
    </p>

    <p><b>Judai: I wouldn't be so sure, Astral.</b></p>

    <p>Judai said as he pointed to something in Yuya's hand. Yugi saw what it was and cursed under his breath.</p><br>

    <p>In Academia, a couple of students were having a stroll in the courtyard when they saw someone laying unconscious on the ground.</p>

    <p><b>Student (Boy): Hey! Is that guy okay?</b><br>Said the boy among the pair.</p>

    <p><b>Student (Girl): I'll look after him, you go get some help!</b></p>

    <p>
        Said the girl that was with him. Nodding, the boy ran inside to find someone. While she waited for help to come, the girl kneeled and watched over the injured, unmoving form of Yuri.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>Student (Girl): What the heck happened to you?</b><br>She whispered.</p>
